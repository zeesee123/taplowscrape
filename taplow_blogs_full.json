It is time for bold experimentation.\n\n\nIn this volatile, tech-driven world, leaders who do bold experimentation & rigorous executions drive sustainable growth, foster organisational \nleadership agility\n and maintain a competitive edge.\n\n\nExperimental leaders validate assumptions early and test new ideas under pressure. They embrace failure as a necessary feedback, they iterate, adapt & persist.\n\n\nWhat is Experimental Leadership?\n\n\nHave you ever seen a chef tasting his dish? He tries everything but only plates the best.\n\n\nExperimental leaders foster curiosity, empower teams to take risks, and treat small tests as core strategy. It’s about \"let’s try this\", not \"let’s hope it works.\"\n\n\nWhy Innovation Alone Isn’t Enough?\n\n\nAs a leader you may love the ‘Eureka!’ moment, but great ideas without follow-through are like concept cars that never see the road.\n\n\nGlobal organisations pour resources into brainstorming, innovation funnels and what not but most of them fail when it comes to delivering change at scale. The modern challenge is clear: Without disciplined execution, even the sharpest innovations fizzle out, leaving competitors to take the lead.\n\n\nThis is why “Bold Experimentation” with a strategy is the core trait of a new-age leader.\n\n\nRecommended Read : \nHow Gen Z is Changing Leadership Dynamics Before Age 30?\n\n\nThe Core of Experimental Leadership\n\n\nThe dogged tenacity of an experimental leader who urges, insists, and demands the logic sequence of testing, learning and adapting is the difference. They celebrate small-scale experiments, seek unbiased feedback, and deploy rapid shifts in response to setbacks as opposed to betting all on rigid plans.\n\n\nThis is not simply a buzzword, but what works in the real world: innovative organizations are ambitious but accountable, which turns their curiosity into repeatable success.\n\n\nRecommended Read: \nThe Burnout Recession: Why Talent Will Quit Before the Market Does\n\n\n101% Working Strategy to Start with Experimental Leadership\n\n\nBased on real world examples, this is 101% workable experimental leadership plan:\n\n\nAdopt a Growth & Learning Mindset\n\n\nLeaders should change the perception of failure as a risk but rather as a learning experience. Organisations succeed because they embrace uncertainty. They ask, “What if it flops?” First, then learn from it.\n\n\nAlign Experiments with Strategic Goals\n\n\nIf you want to cut down cycle time or want to improve the customer satisfaction rate. Identify the specific & measurable results that can be linked to larger business goals before launching.\n\n\nDesign Lean, Hypothesis-Driven Experiments\n\n\nConstruct around low profile hypotheses such as: When we do X, then Y would be the outcome. Then pilot with minimal viable pilots that are small in scope and centred on learning outcomes.\n\n\nFoster a Culture of Psychological Safety\n\n\nTeams must feel free to experiment. Leaders can demonstrate it by changing the question to “What can we learn?” and not asking “What went wrong?”.\n\n\nEnable Ambidextrous Leadership\n\n\nExperimentalist leaders who are strong understand when to exploit and when to explore. Passionately establish creative ideation, then shift to their disciplined implementation once the outcomes inspire.\n\n\nImplement Agile, Adaptive Experimentation\n\n\nSet up sprint cycles of planning → testing → reviewing → iterating. Embed feedback loops and real-time data monitoring to adjust the course mid-stream, exactly as executed in agile frameworks.\n\n\nMeasure Both Quantitative & Qualitative Outcomes\n\n\nAdd in quantitative numbers, such as conversion rates or money saved with qualitative input, either through team reflection or customer interviews. That dual lens deepens learning and sharpens decision-making.\n\n\nInstitutionalise Reflection & Sharing\n\n\nEvery experiment, successful or not, should be a learning milestone. Leaders should organise post‑mortems and retrospectives.\n\n\nRecommended Read: \nPay Transparency in the Workplace: Best Practices & More\n\n\nYour First Steps towards Experimental Leadership\n\n\nStep 1: Pick a small but strategic \nleadership challenge\n.\n\n\nStep 2: Frame it smartly.\n\n\nStep 3: Run a 2-week pilot and measure time saved, and feedback.\n\n\nStep 4: Conduct a reflection session to reveal insights and plans.\n\n\nStep 5: Iterate or scale up based on what you learned.\n\n\nDon’t Miss This Final Takeaway\n\n\nExperimental leadership is a survival skill in today’s hyper-competitive landscape. Start with something bite-sized: an internal pilot, a new customer test, a process tweak and track what you learn.\n\n\nSoon, you’ll have a virtuous loop, curiosity fueling innovation, execution translating it into impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (31)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Supply-chains, manufacturing floors, and energy grids now feel the tremors of rapid, disruptive change.\n\n\nSpurred by leaps in automation, a restless wave of global competition, and freshly minted technologies, hiring managers keep asking for people who can juggle both the mission-wide horizon and the nitty-gritty toolbox.\n\n\nOrganizations that refuse to stand still are poring through field-tested recruitment habits and cherry-picking the ones that actually pay dividends in a landscape that changes month-to-month. Some call it agile hiring; others just call it survival.\n\n\nWhat is Industrial Professional Recruitment?\n\n\nSourcing talent through \nindustrial professional recruitment\n for chemical plants or distribution hubs is different from putting out a general ad on a job board. Sector shortages are biting hard, compliance rules grow thicker every quarter, and senior leaders live in high-stakes, oxygen-thin environments.\n\n\nThe roster itself is astonishingly mixed: crane operators, process engineers, logistics wizards, safety officers, each marching to a different drum. Baby-boomers are handing in badges, fresh graduates know the lingo of smart machines, and the space between those worlds feels both electric and uncertain.\n\n\nA pile of CVs seldom equals a pile of gold. Recruiters who laser-focus on niche skills gain the upper hand, especially when their companies plan for growth that isn’t still on most analysts' whiteboards. Finding somebody who can hit the ground running remains less of a headache than deciding which runner actually belongs on the track.\n\n\nRecommended Read: \n8 Key Metrics to Measure the Impact of Leadership Development\n\n\nWhy is Industrial Professional Recruitment Important?\n\n\nRegulatory mists thicken, tariffs spin in new directions, and customer habits dodge the long-range forecast with alarming agility. The only reliable hedge against that turmoil is a workforce that learns quickly, adapts faster, and, when all else fails, refuses to panic.\n\n\n\n\nAddressing Skills Shortages:\n Specialized recruitment taps directly into niches where talent is scant. In engineering, manufacturing, and logistics the gap between headcount and workload frequently widens; custom searches place adaptable professionals in those yawning slots.\n\n\nEnhancing Operational Efficiency:\n Bringing in personnel who already command the requisite technologies trims the time otherwise spent on boot camps and experiments. The result is faster throughput, smaller payroll backlogs, and an immediate lift in the bottom line.\n\n\nPromoting Innovation:\n \nEffective communication\n opens the door to lateral thinkers eager to tinker with existing processes. Fresh eyes arriving through such channels often upend stale conventions and catalyze unexpected breakthroughs.\n\n\nImproving Quality of Hire:\n Competency grids, work-sample tests, and behavioral panels cut through rehearsed answers and reveal true capability. Organizations that stick with this rigor watch performance stabilize, satisfaction swell, and turnover taper.\n\n\nSupporting Organizational Growth:\n Sector-specific pipeline mapping does not just meet tomorrow's deadline, it queues candidates for the next five product cycles. Before current openings cool, a new roster is already warming up.\n\n\nFacilitating Cultural Fit and Team Cohesion:\n Hiring for shared values welds teams that rally around common goals instead of drifting on personal agendas. Cohesion fosters a work environment where people take constructive conflict in stride and productivity rarely stutters.\n\n\nNavigating Regulatory and Compliance Challenges:\n Selective recruitment allows firms to hire candidates already well-versed in the statutes and regulations shaping their sector. This familiarity can significantly lower the likelihood of costly compliance breaches.\n\n\nBuilding Sustainable Workforce:\n When employers prioritize hires with enduring potential rather than immediate utility, they lay the groundwork for a team that grows in step with the industry's shifting landscape.\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Read: \nCEO Training: 5 Ultimate Benefits of Leadership Training\n\n\nBenefits of Industrial Professional Recruitment\n\n\nIn an era where skilled talent is the backbone of successful organizations, a strategic recruitment process tailored to the industrial sector provides several key benefits:\n\n\n\n\nAccess to a Specialized Talent Pool\n\n\nEnhanced Cultural Fit\n\n\nShorter Recruitment Cycles\n\n\nImproved Quality of Hire\n\n\nMitigation of Recruitment Risks\n\n\nAdaptation to Industry Trends\n\n\nEnhanced Employer Brand\n\n\nSupport for Long-term Growth and Stability\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Approaches to Talent Acquisition\n\n\nThe playbook to building an unstoppable workforce has changed. Here’s how today' s forward-thinking companies approach industrial recruitment:\n\n\n\n\nData-Driven Workforce Planning: Global organisations are using analytics to predict talent needs, spot emerging skill gaps, and ensure alignment with long-term goals.\n\n\nEmployer Branding: Majorly, top talents always choose organizations that have a compelling vision, clear values, and a reputation for innovation. Organisations that tell their story beyond just the job attracts mission-driven professionals.\n\n\nConsultancy and \nInterim Management Services\n: Lean on experts, even if only for a critical period. Communication sector consultancy and interim management services make it possible to fill urgent leadership gaps while continuing the search for permanent hires.\n\n\nDiversity & Inclusivity: Industrial leaders are moving ahead with diversity to boost creativity & resilience which in turn improves retention and performance.\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Read: \nTop 5 Change Management Models and Their Applications\n\n\nLeveraging Recruitment Technology and Soft Skills\n\n\nTechnology has become your right hand. Today’s \nstreamlined recruitment\n solutions use AI to screen resumes, automate interviews, and score candidates on predictive analytics. This results in faster hiring cycles and reduced risk of bad hires.\n\n\nBut here’s a truth bomb: Even the world’s best tech can’t replace the power of \nsoft skills recruitment\n. Reading between the lines in an interview, managing delicate negotiations, and building authentic relationships are as critical to hiring success as any fancy algorithm.\n\n\nYet, human touchpoints, empathy, intuition, personalization, deliver the “X factor” that no technology can replicate.\n\n\nScreening, Interviewing, and Selection: Best Practices\n\n\n\n\nStructured, Streamlined Recruitment: Rushed hires are costly mistakes. Use consistent, robust assessment frameworks tailored to each role.\n\n\nBehavioral & Situational Assessment: Go beyond credentials, test for adaptability, leadership, and alignment with your company culture.\n\n\nCollaborative Evaluation: Decision-making shouldn’t fall to just one person. Cross-functional panels and 360-feedback minimize bias and boost diversity.\n\n\nOnboarding for Success: The candidate journey doesn’t end with an offer letter. A thorough onboarding process ensures retention and accelerates productivity from day one.\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Read: \nYou’ll Face These 7 Leadership Challenges: Prepare Yourself\n\n\nEthical Decision Making & Leadership in Recruitment\n\n\nThere’s a reason “integrity” sits atop every value statement. \nEthical decision making in leadership\n is more than just a corporate buzzword, it’s a business imperative. Transparent hiring practices, fair compensation, and a commitment to sustainability are non-negotiable for today’s workforce.\n\n\n\n\nPerformance with Principles: Ethical leaders set the tone for responsible recruitment, building trust internally and externally.\n\n\nPromoting Diversity and Fairness: Aligning recruitment strategies with broader ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) goals isn’t just socially responsible, it’s smart business.\n\n\nLeading by Example: Your next great hire wants to work for a company whose leaders walk the talk.\n\n\n\n\nThe Taplow Group Advantage\n\n\nReady to shake up your hiring game in industrial professional recruitment?

That dual approach trims days off the calendar and often turns up sharper candidates in tight markets such as manufacturing or aerospace engineering.\n\n\nQ: How do industrial staffing firms support job seekers?\n\n\nA: Placement firms work the matchmaking angle hard, lining up what a workers résumé says with what a job ad demands. Many sweeten the deal with fringe benefits-health plans, holiday pay, even a line on 401(k) money-so the offer feels concrete instead of theoretical.\n\n\nQ: What recruitment challenges do industrial firms face today?\n\n\nA: Even seasoned pros stumble over the usual roadblocks: a yawning talent gap, candidates who change their minds, or bosses who want results yesterday. Keeping the list mixed-gender, racially balanced, and technically sound only adds pressure.\n\n\nQ: Why are employee referrals effective in industrial recruitment?\n\n\nA: Referrals cut through a lot of that noise because a shop-floor welders buddy is usually a safer bet than an anonymous CV. Problems shrink, turnover drops, and the price tag rarely matches what an agency invoices.\n\n\nQ: What are the pros and cons of external recruitment?\n\n\nA: Outside hires do carry an upfront cost in orientation dollars and training hours, yet they shove new ideas into a team that has done the same drill for years. Most managers say the hassle pays back once a mission-critical slot is filled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (251)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Authenticity & Emotional quotient give a competitive edge to humans.\n\n\nWhat Does “Authentic Leadership” Look Like in 2025?\n\n\nRemember the old saying, “People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.” Well, it holds more truth than ever.\n\n\nAuthentic leaders in today’s digital world bring their whole selves to work. They lead with vulnerability, own their mistakes, and don’t hide behind polished PowerPoint slides.\n\n\nInstead, they connect purpose to action and create environments where people feel safe being human.\n\n\nRecommended Read: \nYou’ll Face These 7 Leadership Challenges: Prepare Yourself\n\n\n(EQ vs. IQ) Why Emotional Intelligence Is the Real Superpower?\n\n\nAs a leader, you must have learned that IQ wins, but IQ alone doesn’t make you a great leader. Multiple global studies suggest that EQ (emotional intelligence) is the differentiator.\n\n\nEQ means knowing yourself, recognising stress, reading the virtual “temperature” in a Zoom call, and responding empathetically.\n\n\nIt’s about building trust, handling conflict, and cultivating a culture where people can openly innovate and challenge the status quo.\n\n\nWe operate in a VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous) and BANI (brittle, anxious, nonlinear, incomprehensible) world. In virtual meetings, hidden cues and the need to scan screens make trust more fragile. Authentic leaders who bring transparency, integrity, and purpose into digital spaces stand out.\n\n\nRecommended Read: \nThe Role of Emotional Intelligence in CEO Effectiveness\n\n\nEQ as a Must-Have for Modern Leaders\n\n\nEQ matters today because technology has opened the door for massive change globally. Leaders now manage hybrid, global teams and drive transformation while navigating diverse cultures, 24/7 digital connections, and digital overload.\n\n\nOnly emotionally intelligent leaders can break through in this noisy landscape. They foster belonging, model resilience, and set an example of embracing change rather than fearing it.\n\n\nHow to Build EQ in the Leadership and Beyond\n\n\nOne promising thing about EQ is that it can be learned & improved over time. Here are four ways leaders and organizations can level up:\n\n\n\n\nSelf-reflection:\n Start with honest feedback—ask peers, “What’s one thing I can do better?” It’s humbling, but growth comes from discomfort.\n\n\nActive Listening:\n Don’t just wait for your turn to speak. In meetings, be all in—no multitasking. It’s how trust and collaboration start.\n\n\nContinuous Learning:\n Enroll in programs that make you stretch. Growth is a lifelong journey, not a checkbox.\n\n\nInclusive Communication:\n In a digital age, words can be misread. Be intentional and transparent, and check in often, especially with remote or multicultural teams.\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Read: \nFuture Trends in Leadership Consulting: What to Expect in 2025\n\n\nHigh EQ - Higher the Success\n\n\nAt \nThe Taplow Group\n, our experts always recommend that organizations have EQ as their core strategy if they are to pursue high performance and high retention.\n\n\nTechnical skills are just an entry pass; the real differentiator is EQ today. A leader must possess the heart to understand themselves and others, master managing emotions, and use awareness to drive results for the organisation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (520)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Modern day leaders and global organisations have replaced this secrecy with clarity.\n\n\nThe driving force behind this change is the wave of employees demanding for honesty, fairness, and a greater sense of belonging.\n\n\nLet’s understand salary transparency, its evolution and how it gained traction.\n\n\nWhat is Pay Transparency?\n\n\nPay transparency is basically the act of openly providing compensation information to everyone in an organization.\n\n\nTo do this, you may talk about the pay range in job ads or explain the process for bonuses, raise policies and how bonuses are given in detail with team members.\n\n\nSome companies even go fully transparent, openly publishing every employee’s salary and the factors influencing those figures.\n\n\nThe goal is to ensure everyone understands how pay decisions are made and why.\n\n\nWhy is Pay Transparency Important?\n\n\nSecrecy in \nsalary transparency\n may lead to suspicion, pay gaps and eat up the respect among employees.\n\n\nNow that honesty in business is important, talking about salaries supports an environment that values and respects people.\n\n\nTransparency in pay is very important for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) at both the organization and \nleadership consulting firms\n.\n\n\nPay Transparency in the Workplace\n\n\nWith many organizations shifting away from “closed-door” discussions to more open dialogue. Regulations, like the EU Pay Transparency Directive, have set global precedents, requiring organizations to disclose salary ranges and report on gender pay gaps.\n\n\nThe push doesn’t just come from legislators; job seekers and employees now demand it, and companies that lag risk becoming less attractive to top talent. Ultimately, salary transparency helps set expectations, informs career planning, and empowers individuals to speak up if they notice pay discrepancies.\n\n\nCommunication sector consultancy\n firms emphasize that the key isn’t just in what you share, but how you communicate those details, making \nempathy in the workplace\n absolutely essential to the process.\n\n\nRecommended Read : \nKey Role of Succession Planning in Leadership Development\n\n\nEvolution of Pay Transparency: Global Trends\n\n\nIn the past, discussing your salary was considered taboo; now, in regions like North America and much of Europe, posting salary ranges in job ads is quickly becoming standard practice.\n\n\nMost notably the EU Pay Transparency Directive, is requiring organizations to actively monitor, address, and publish data relating to pay equity and gaps. By the end of 2025, many countries will enforce regular gender pay gap reporting and require companies to provide employees with clear comparisons to peers.\n\n\nSocial movements, digital salary comparison tools, and the wider adoption of remote work are all pushing organizations toward a more transparent model. Businesses that want to remain attractive and competitive must keep up with this sweeping transformation.\n\n\nBenefits of Pay Transparency\n\n\nThe advantages of \npay transparency in the workplace\n include:\n\n\n\n\nStronger Trust and Engagement: Being open allows others to trust your leadership and build trusting relationships with your colleagues.\n\n\nAttract and Retain Top Talent: As compared to unfair and secretive businesses, potential employees are attracted to firms that are fair and free with information about pay.\n\n\nSupports Fairness and Equity: When \npay transparency policy\n is always used, it helps to narrow pay gaps between groups which makes DEI initiatives stronger.\n\n\nBoosts Productivity and Satisfaction: When staff feels valued and pleased with salaries, they usually want to keep working there.\n\n\nEnhances Reputation: In competitive markets, firms noted for transparent salaries usually attract more customers, clients and business partners.\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Read: \n8 Key Metrics to Measure the Impact of Leadership Development\n\n\nDrawbacks of Pay Transparency\n\n\nFull pay transparency has its complexities listed below:\n\n\n\n\nPotential for Conflict: When pay disparities come to light, it may spark discontent, especially if historical inequities exist.\n\n\nPrivacy Concerns: Some employees may feel uncomfortable with personal salary details being broadly accessible.\n\n\nComparison Culture: Sometimes, when people concentrate too much on the amount they earn, it can create problems within a team or cause unhealthy rivalry.\n\n\nImplementation Challenges: Making sure pay data is correct, in the proper context and shared in a positive way needs a lot of effort and careful planning.\n\n\n\n\nYet, organizations that see the future in a positive way use these challenges to foster frank exchanges, keep improving and build a stronger team culture.\n\n\nDevoting to \nethical decision making in leadership\n improves how staff members feel about their job and increases the organisation’s positive reputation.\n\n\nBest Practices for Implementing Pay Transparency\n\n\nHere’s how to make pay transparency work for your organization:\n\n\nAssess Current Pay Structures\n\n\nAudit all compensation data for hidden inequities and develop a clear, equitable baseline.\n\n\nDevelop a Comprehensive Pay Transparency Policy\n\n\nPrepare clear directions about which data is to be shared, who with and at what frequency. Align this policy with local laws and global best practices.\n\n\nTrain Management and Leaders\n\n\nLeaders—especially in \nexecutive interim management\n—must handle pay discussions with sensitivity and empathy, championing fair, unbiased communication.\n\n\nEmbrace Clear and Open Communication\n\n\nUse multiple channels—meetings, town halls, one-on-ones—to explain pay policies and reasoning behind decisions.\n\n\nImplement Pay Equity Reporting\n\n\nUse analytic tools to review pay regularly, adjusting quickly if discrepancies arise.\n\n\nEncourage Ongoing Dialogue\n\n\nCreate safe spaces where staff can raise questions and provide feedback on pay matters.\n\n\nReview and Update Regularly\n\n\nStay proactive and adjust policies to reflect regulatory changes and evolving organizational goals.\n\n\nCommunication sector consultancy\n experts underscore that the change isn’t just about posting numbers. It’s about building a culture of trust where transparency, context, and empathy go hand in hand.\n\n\nRecommended Read: \nTop 5 Change Management Models and Their Applications\n\n\nHow The Taplow Group Supports Pay Transparency?\n\n\nNavigating salary transparency can feel overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be.

Businesses are no longer measured solely by their ability to maintain resources but are judged by the positive impact they create for people and the planet.\n\n\nThis mindset shift is shaking up boardrooms and supply chains everywhere.\n\n\nWhy 'Sustainability' No Longer Suffices?\n\n\nDifferent times & decades demand different revolutions.\n\n\nSustainability had its moment back then when the goal was to reduce footprints and keep ecosystems from getting worse. But as we move ahead, “maintenance” isn’t just enough for today’s accelerating climate and nature crises.\n\n\nRegulatory pressures are mounting, and stakeholders, especially younger generations are demanding bold, restorative action from brands they trust.

Whether it’s a clash of personalities, a difference in work style, or the pressure of deadlines, conflict is a natural symptom of diverse, high-functioning teams.\n\n\nManaging conflict properly within an organisation helps shape its success or failure.\n\n\nFor major companies and their C-suite executives, handling conflicts is critical for helping the company survive challenges, encouraging new ideas and ensuring a healthy workplace.\n\n\nWhat is Conflict Management?\n\n\nThe idea of conflict management includes spotting, handling and solving arguments constructively.\n\n\nThe definition for conflict management is to guide differences, sparking creativity, improving how things are done and encouraging closer working relationships. Essentially, when conflict management is effective, different viewpoints are used to nurture growth and better outcomes for the organization.\n\n\nConflict management in leadership\n fosters team success and does not lower morale.\n\n\nEffective Conflict Management Strategies\n\n\nThe best conflict management style is\n one that adapts to the situation while fostering respect, collaboration, and constructive dialogue:\n\n\n\n\nCommunication Planning:\n Creating structured ways for employees to express concerns early can prevent small issues from spiralling into major clashes.\n\n\nProactive Mediation:\n Having HR or a service provider step in to ensure parties understand and agree on important issues.\n\n\nCollaborative Problem-Solving:\n Persuading teams to identify the main problems and come up with win-win answers.\n\n\nClear Policy Frameworks:\n Having clear guidelines means everyone is aware of the process for reporting, building up and concluding conflicts.\n\n\nLeadership Training:\n Developing leadership metrics that include emotional intelligence and conflict-resolution skills drive ongoing improvement.\n\n\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, our consultants bring a nuanced understanding of diverse industries, enabling companies to resolve internal disputes, improve \nleadership metrics\n, and drive transformation without derailing core operations.\n\n\n5 Conflict Management Styles\n\n\nEvery leader and team member brings their approach to handling conflict. Here are five classic styles recognised globally, each with its place:\n\n\n#1: Competing\n\n\nAssertive, goal-oriented, and decisive. Best when quick, firm action is needed.\n\n\n#2: Accommodating\n\n\nPrioritises relationships and preserves harmony, often at personal expense. Useful for minor issues or when the relationship matters most.\n\n\n#3: Avoiding\n\n\nDeliberate withdrawal or inaction. Sometimes wise for low-stakes or emotionally charged conflicts that need cooling off.\n\n\n#4: Collaborating\n\n\nIt seeks win-win outcomes by integrating different perspectives, which is the strongest way to tackle complex issues.\n\n\n#5: Compromising\n\n\nSeeks middle ground where both sides give up something. Effective for resolving equally strong arguments or time-bound disagreements.\n\n\nThe top-tier organisations understand when to flex between these styles based on the situation’s urgency, importance, and underlying dynamics.\n\n\nRecommended Read: \nThe Only Succession Planning Guide You Need in 2025\n\n\nTypes of Conflict Resolution in the Workplace\n\n\nNot all workplace conflicts are created equal. The most successful organisations proactively recognise and address these, so they never fester:\n\n\nTask-based Conflicts\n\n\nDisagreements about how to accomplish work are often resolved through clarification and negotiation.\n\n\nRelationship Conflicts\n\n\nStem from personal differences in values, communication, or work style. Resolution often requires mediation and empathy.\n\n\nProcess Conflicts\n\n\nArise over \"how\" the work is done, commonly resolved by reevaluating processes or roles.\n\n\nValue Conflicts\n\n\nClash of beliefs or ethics—these can be sensitive and must be approached with cultural competence and HR support.\n\n\nInterest Conflicts\n\n\nCompeting personal or professional goals are best solved when both sides understand broader business objectives.\n\n\nAn \nexample of conflict resolution\n is when two team members with opposing ideas collaborate to find a compromise that integrates the strengths of both perspectives.\n\n\nRecommended Read: \n7 Key Leadership Trends to Pick in 2025 & Lead Efficiently\n\n\nConflict Management at the Workplace\n\n\nSo, \nhow to manage conflict in the workplace\n?

And do you know why so many talented professionals are jumping ship before the financial storm hits? This insight has it all.\n\n\nThe New Crisis: Burnout Before the Market Falls\n\n\nToday’s most valuable asset, top talent, is leaving not because of pink slips, but because of burnout. \nRecent leadership forecasts show that nearly 40%\n of managers and countless high-potential employees are contemplating resignation, not out of fear of layoffs, but due to crushing workloads, lack of support, and waning trust.\n\n\nThe change is noticeable as employees now have unprecedented transparency about their market value, peer cultures, and better options, meaning exhaustion, not recession, drives their career moves.\n\n\nRecommended Read:\n \nThe One Trait Top CEOs Share in 2025\n\n\nWhat’s Driving the Burnout Exodus?\n\n\nWorkplaces feel like pressure cookers, and there’s only so long that top talent will stew. But why are individuals and leaders feeling out of place?\n\n\n\n\nChronic Overwork & Poor Work Design:\n Employees are overloaded, expected to do more with less, constantly “on” in our hyperconnected world.\n\n\nIneffective Management:\n 70% of team engagement rides on management quality, but only 29% of staff trust their boss, a recipe for disconnection.\n\n\nStalled Growth:\n Ambitious staff crave learning and upward mobility. Nearly 70% would leave for a company that genuinely invests in their growth, not just lip service training.\n\n\nCompensation & Recognition Gaps:\n Rising living costs and transparent pay benchmarking mean that lacklustre rewards are impossible to hide.\n\n\nErosion of Purpose & Culture:\n Employees want meaning, inclusion, and real collaboration, not just a paycheck.\n\n\n\n\nConsequences for Organisations\n\n\nIgnoring burnout is the corporate equivalent of letting the foundation of your building quietly crumble. You will have to suffer - Sky-high turnover costs (six to nine times a leader's salary!), loss of institutional knowledge, stalled innovation, and toxic undercurrents that repel high performers and new hires alike.\n\n\nProductivity plunges, morale unravels, and corporate reputation takes a direct hit, hardly a winning strategy when every organisation is fighting for the same shrinking pool of motivated talent.\n\n\nRecommended Read: \nKey Role of Succession Planning in Leadership Development\n\n\nHow Can Organisations Fix This? Practical Strategies\n\n\nThe path forward isn’t complicated; it’s just uncomfortable for those clinging to old playbooks. Ready to future-proof your talent? Here’s what works:\n\n\nCultivate a Culture of Trust and Belonging\n\n\nDon’t just preach culture, practice radical transparency, let employees see (and speak to) the real leaders, and bake empathy into your daily rituals.\n\n\nOverhaul Leadership Development\n\n\nInvest in \nemotionally intelligent leadership\n and empower managers to make decisions like owners. Reverse-hierarchy rotations let execs “walk a mile” in frontliners’ shoes, building real-world empathy and stronger connections.\n\n\nBe Bold With Flexibility and Wellness\n\n\nSmart organisations offer more than laptops and a flexible schedule. Growth sabbaticals, well-being stipends, mental health support, these aren’t perks; they’re necessities for sustainable energy.\n\n\nPersonalise Professional Growth\n\n\nSkip the generic e-learning modules, map individual career paths, offer mentoring, and create learning journeys that actually matter to your people.\n\n\nRethink Compensation and Recognition\n\n\nBenchmark regularly, reward visible impact (not just hours clocked), and celebrate contributions out loud.\n\n\nListen and Act\n\n\nAnonymous feedback tools and fast, authentic follow-up are the new management superpowers when employees see that feedback drives real change, loyalty soars.\n\n\nRecommended Read : \nUnderstanding Generational Differences in Leadership Styles\n\n\nThe Opportunity in the Crisis\n\n\nBurnout isn’t just a threat; it’s a wake-up call, and in every crisis lies opportunity. The organisations that listen, adapt, and put human energy at the heart of their operating model will leapfrog competitors who are still stuck in the “work harder for less” rut.\n\n\nIn the fast-moving talent economy, those who fix burnout before it’s too late will have the edge when markets rebound.\n\n\nKey Takeaway\n\n\nYou never know, the burnout recession may be knocking on your door. With intentional focus, your organisation can become an oasis that smart, driven talent runs toward, not away from.\n\n\nStart honest conversations, empower your managers, and view employee well-being as the ultimate metric.\n\n\nIf you want to win over your co-workers and colleagues, then you must make a place where ambition and well-being aren’t trade-offs, but twins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (1323)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "7 Key Leadership Trends to Pick in 2025 & Lead Efficiently\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nThursday, May 15, 2025\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeadership trends are rapidly evolving, and as a leader, it’s important to keep pace.\n\n\nTechnologies, workforce expectations and the global business environment are moving so fast. CEOs, founders, and C-suite executives need fresh approaches rooted in key leadership trends for 2025 to lead efficiently, and they must be familiar with the \nbenefits of leadership development\n.\n\n\nScroll down this expert insight and learn what’s driving success for world-class leaders and organisations right now.\n\n\nRecommended Read: \nTop 5 Change Management Models and Their Applications\n\n\nLeadership Trends 2025\n\n\n#1: Data-Driven Decision-Making\n\n\nInstinct has always led the leaders, but in 2025, data is leading the way for the leaders. Leaders who are leveraging real-time data, whether financial dashboards, workforce analytics, or customer feedback, spot opportunities and risks faster than their peers.\n\n\nIt’s not about gut feeling alone. Best-in-class CEOS invest in the latest analytical tools, blending intuition with hard numbers for sharper, faster choices. Imagine navigating a ship with both a seasoned captain and the world’s smartest radar.\n\n\n#2: Agile and Adaptive Leadership\n\n\nRemember when five-year plans were set in stone? 2025 is not about those rigid strategies. Leaders today are building agile cultures, adapting swiftly to market disruptions, new technologies, and changing customer needs.\n\n\nThey inspire flexibility, reward experimentation, and know when to pivot. Business survival now comes down to how quickly you can spot a wave and ride it rather than brace for impact.\n\n\n#3: Emotional Intelligence & Empathy\n\n\nWith high-pressure environments and diverse remote teams, “soft” skills lead to hard results.\n\n\nForward-thinking leaders invest in emotional intelligence and think about reading the room, regulating their own emotions, and understanding the unique needs of their teams. Empathy is the new age element that is driving trust, engagement and real performance in a hybrid work world.\n\n\nLearn \nhow to measure leadership development\n effectively and understand the key metrics that indicate successful leadership growth within your organisation.\n\n\n#4: Hybrid & Remote Team Optimization\n\n\nHybrid and fully remote work are here to stay. In 2025, high-performing leaders master the tools, rituals, and emotional rhythms of distributed teams.\n\n\nThey set clear KPIs, promote asynchronous collaboration, and ensure everyone feels valued and connected. Miss this trend, and you’ll lose top talent to more flexible competitors.\n\n\n#5: Building Inclusive Cultures\n\n\nDiversity is only the starting line; inclusion is where the real race is won. \nIndustry leaders who support 2025\n leadership trends have already made up their minds to build an inclusive culture and lead with efficiency.\n\n\nCEOs and organisations foster environments where every voice matters across genders, cultures, backgrounds, and generations. They use metrics to spot bias, invest in mentorship, and empower rising leaders from every corner.\n\n\n#6: Tech-First Leadership\n\n\nWhether it’s leveraging AI for efficient operations, implementing cutting-edge cybersecurity, or piloting immersive training in the metaverse, leaders who embrace technology set their firms light years ahead.\n\n\nThey aren’t just tech consumers; they shape and drive the digital transformation journey within their industries.\n\n\n#7: Sustainable & Ethical Leadership\n\n\nSustainability is not just a buzzword—it’s quickly becoming a baseline expectation from talent, investors, and customers worldwide.\n\n\nIn 2025, successful leaders set clear ESG goals, communicate transparently, and anchor company growth in ethical business practices.\n\n\nThe Future of Leadership\n\n\nLeaders who weave these trends into their DNA won’t just survive—they’ll thrive. Continuous leadership development is no longer optional; it’s essential.\n\n\nGlobal \nBoard Governance Services Firms\n are seeing a surge in demand, as companies seek independent, skilled advice to steer their vision and operations. The most admired leaders are those who build networks, nurture learning cultures, and move boldly into the unknown.\n\n\nYou must be well-versed in the \nfuture leadership trends\n and must adapt quickly to the world.\n\n\nRecent Trends in Management Style\n\n\nManagement styles are evolving quickly. Authoritarian models are out; collaborative and coaching-led approaches are in. Instead of dictating, leaders ask questions, encourage peer accountability, and foster safe spaces for creativity.\n\n\nToday’s leaders act as guides, spotting strengths, fostering innovation, and balancing autonomy with shared goals.\n\n\nOn top of that, leadership advisory services are in high demand, helping boards and executives audit their management styles and refine their impact. Modern leaders use 360-degree feedback and even “reverse mentoring” to learn from the newest generation.\n\n\nRecommended Read: \nImportance of Effective Communication Planning and Execution\n\n\nHow The Taplow Group Can Help?\n\n\nNavigating this fast-moving world takes expert guidance.

No way, no, the answer resoundingly is no.\n\n\nLet’s break down what really matters about these roles—and why understanding the gap is crucial for companies and business leaders everywhere.\n\n\nWho is the Founder?\n\n\nFounders are people who have a high level of personal involvement in the company’s purpose and goals.\n\n\nThe founder is the person who initially came up with the business, took the initial risk, and made the initial vision of the business a reality through a tangible startup.\n\n\nDriven by passion, creativity, and a desire to solve a challenge or disrupt an existing sector, founders are the backbone of the company. Their action aligns with their talk, their investment in the company’s early days, the recruitment of core team members, and shaping the culture.\n\n\nIn many cases, the founder is also the first CEO, but that isn’t always the case as companies evolve.\n\n\nCompany Founder Responsibilities\n\n\nHere’s the in-depth analysis of what a founder has under their hats:\n\n\n\n\nSetting the Vision and Mission:\n Founders are the ones who establish the foundation for the company’s ideals, cultural values, and even the top goals.\n\n\nSecuring Funding:\n The founders seek to raise funds through the solicitation of investors and personal savings to help kickstart and maintain the company during its initial years.\n\n\nProduct Development:\n Founders tend to do their work in developing the first product or service, typically undertaking such jobs as coding, designing, or making prototypes.\n\n\nAssembling the Team:\n Founders pick the first team of members who are inspired by the vision of the business and present no problems at the beginning.\n\n\nLegal and Administrative Work:\n From registering the company to sorting out initial agreements and compliance, much of the unglamorous early work falls to the founder.\n\n\nRisk-Taker-in-Chief:\n Founders own the biggest risks—financially, reputationally, and emotionally—while the business is still fledgling.\n\n\n\n\nAs the business expands, some founders focus on the board or advisory roles, whereas others remain focused on taking the company into long-term success.\n\n\nRecommended Read: \nLeadership and Ethical Decision-Making: Our Perspective\n\n\nWhat is a CEO?\n\n\nThe CEO or Chief Executive Officer sits at the top of the organization and manages day-to-day operations. While founders conceive the first ideas, CEOs are the driving forces that bring those ideas to lasting, financial success.\n\n\nCEOs may be the founders, but they often aren’t. Often, organizations scout for a CEO who has skills in growth, management, and complicated leadership, who the founder usually leads as the business develops through different phases of its lifecycle.\n\n\nThe board of directors and shareholders usually hold the decision-making power and accountability of a CEO, which ensures the company’s long-term success.\n\n\nKey CEO Responsibilities\n\n\nThe key \nCEO responsibilities\n include:\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Planning:\n CEOs chart the company’s growth course, operational strategies, and future direction, translating vision into reality.\n\n\nOperational Oversight:\n They manage the executive team—COOs, CFOs, CTOs—and make sure every department is aligned with corporate goals.\n\n\nDecision Making:\n Final call on major decisions lies with the CEO, whether it’s market expansion, new products, or investment opportunities.\n\n\nStakeholder Communication:\n The CEO bridges boardroom and business, investors and employees, media and markets. They’re the organization’s chief spokesperson and ambassador.\n\n\nResource Allocation:\n Responsible for where money, time, and talent are spent for the utmost impact.\n\n\nFinancial Performance:\n CEOs ultimately answer for profit, loss, growth, and sometimes even the company’s very survival.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s worth noting that top CEOs often come with years of experience and advanced credentials, and they sometimes undergo specialized \nleadership training\n to stay on the cutting edge of global business management.\n\n\nRecommended Read: \n8 Key Metrics to Measure the Impact of Leadership Development\n\n\nDifference Between CEO and Founder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect       \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFounder\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCEO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrigin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarts the company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsually hired/appointed to run the company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVision, values, initial product innovation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecution, strategy, managing growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRole Evolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan stay or transition out as the company grows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay come in at different stages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthority\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimarily through ownership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy board/shareholder appointment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Stake\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsually owns significant equity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay have equity, but mostly paid salary/bonus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk Exposure\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBears most early-stage risks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore operational, less personal risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAt startups, these roles are often merged—the founder is the CEO. However, as companies grow, the need for specialized skill sets often drives a split.\n\n\nRecommended Read:\n \nCertified CEO Training Program - A great starting point to your leadership journey\n\n\nHow The Taplow Group Can Support CEO and Founder Leadership?\n\n\nLeadership has become crucial in every organization today.

In contrast, CEOs of reputable organizations focus mainly on strategic goals, internal processes’ fine-tuning, multiplication of the size of a company, and management of complex relations with important stakeholders, such as boards, investors, and large workforces. They delegate routine functions to the senior leaders and focus on creating sustainable growth, monitoring risk prevention, and managing corporate POS.\n\n\nQ: What skills are essential for both founders and CEOs?\n\n\nA: Both founders and CEOs require strong leadership skills, including:\n\n\n\n\nThe ability to motivate teams, communicate vision clearly, and make tough decisions.\n\n\nEmotional intelligence is a must, enabling them to build relationships across stakeholders.\n\n\nProblem-solving, resilience, and adaptability are shared traits critical across the founder and CEO spectrum.\n\n\nAdditionally, founders benefit from entrepreneurial risk-taking skills, whereas CEOs often enhance their leadership through formal training and consulting.\n\n\n\n\nQ: Do founders always maintain control of the companies they start?\n\n\nA: Not always. Founders may lose control after raising external funding or appointing boards and professional executives, although they often retain significant influence through equity ownership or board roles.\n\n\nQ: How important is leadership training for CEOs and founders?\n\n\nA: Leadership training is critical to equip CEOs and founders with skills to navigate operational challenges, inspire teams, and drive innovation and growth. Many organizations undertake such training to enhance executive effectiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (914)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

They are here to transform the leadership before they even hit 30.\n\n\nThis new generation doesn’t just bring fresh faces to the workplace; they’re rewriting the rules of what it means to lead. For organizations, especially those with eyes on agility and innovation, these changes are impossible to ignore.\n\n\nWhy Gen Z is Different: Values, Technology, and Expectations\n\n\nGen Z grew up in a hyper-connected world. They don’t know a time before smartphones, social media, or instant access to information.\n\n\nBut their differences aren’t just digital. These are the key traits that make them stand out:\n\n\n\n\nTheir unwavering commitment to authentic values\n\n\nTheir no-compromise stance on workplace inclusivity\n\n\nA desire for both personal and societal impact.\n\n\n\n\nGen Z’s aren’t just looking for jobs; they are seeking meaning in their quest.\n\n\nRecommended Read:\n \nDigital Communication Tools: Future of Workplace Collaboration\n\n\nCollaboration Over Hierarchy\n\n\nThe days are long gone when the sole aim was to climb the corporate ladder.\n\n\nNow \nleadership\n isn’t about the corner office or the biggest business card for the Gen Z’s. They want to make a difference and work together with a purpose.\n\n\nAs far as the values are concerned, this generation values collaboration over hierarchy. They prefer team-driven solutions and open dialogue instead of top-down mandates. They have broken down the old-fashioned silos and treated their managers more as mentors or peers rather than authoritative figures.\n\n\nFlexibility, Well-being, and Purpose as Priorities\n\n\nMajorly, this generation doesn’t just work for the paychecks. Their work is a critical part of their identity and well-being.\n\n\nFrom flexible hours to remote work and mental health support, these aren’t just perks; they’re Gen Z’s expectations. This generation is more likely to turn down promotions or leadership tracks if they involve chronic stress or work-life imbalance.\n\n\nThey want their roles to align with their values and to support both their growth and their wellness—it’s a far cry from the “live to work” attitudes of previous generations.\n\n\nThe Rise of “Conscious Unbossing” and Freelance Leadership\n\n\nGen Z is challenging the idea that leadership equals managing a team or climbing the corporate ladder.\n\n\nMany prefer to specialize and become experts in their field rather than chasing traditional managerial roles. Gen Z deliberately opts out of stressful leadership for alternative career paths like freelancing, project-based assignments, or portfolio careers. The gig economy and digital platforms have made this more accessible than ever.\n\n\nRecommended Read: \nHow Does Leadership Advisory Improve Organizational Performance?\n\n\nThe Challenges Organizations Face\n\n\nHR and C-suite leaders are feeling the impact.\n\n\nTraditional leadership pipelines are drying up, and most of the surveys show that Gen Z is 1.7 times more likely to turn down leadership roles to protect their well-being than older cohorts.\n\n\nBurnout, stress, and a lack of work-life balance have Gen Z thinking twice before taking on extra responsibility. This “silent shift” means organizations can no longer rely on old-school training or promotional incentives to fill future leadership gaps.\n\n\nRecommended Read:\n \nYou’ll Face These 7 Leadership Challenges: Prepare Yourself\n\n\nAction Steps for C-Suite Executives and Talent Leaders\n\n\nSo, what should organizations do to attract, inspire, and develop Gen Z leaders?\n\n\n\n\nStart by infusing purpose into every role, not just the job description.\n\n\nFoster psychologically safe environments\n\n\nAllow for flexible, individualized growth paths\n\n\nGo for mentorships, peer-based learning, and value-driven development programs.\n\n\nModel sustainable leadership at the executive level.\n\n\n\n\nChange or Be Left Behind\n\n\nThis silent shift isn’t a workplace rebellion; it’s a thoughtful response to today’s realities.\n\n\nThe era of the autocratic leader is fading fast. Gen Z’s leadership style is rooted in collaboration, well-being, and authenticity, which offers a blueprint for a thriving, innovative organization.\n\n\nRecommended Read: \nUnderstanding Generational Differences in Leadership Styles\n\n\nThe future belongs to those who can adapt, listen, and grow alongside this game-changing generation.\n\n\nConsult \nexecutive search experts\n at The Taplow Group and lead the change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (1453)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

But tech skills aren’t just for CTOs anymore, and AI & automation have not just become buzzwords but are the need of the hour.\n\n\nEvery C-suite leader- \nCEO\n, CFO, CHRO, and beyond- is expected to have AI fluency for all good reasons.\n\n\nAI is transforming not just IT but also business models, customer expectations, and the very nature of leadership.

It’s like when the C-suite leaders are fluent in AI, they can connect the dots between the tech & business results faster and make more informed decisions.\n\n\nAI fluency doesn’t only mean that you must be tech-savvy.

AI-proficient leaders can actively spot issues like algorithmic bias, misuse of data, or compliance gaps—before they become headlines. They ask tough questions about transparency, inclusivity, and trust.\n\n\nCollaborating with Tech and Data Teams:\n AI fluency means you can have productive, informed discussions with your CIO, CTO, and data scientists—translating business goals into tech priorities and vice versa. No more cross-talk or missed opportunities due to language barriers.\n\n\nLeading Change in AI Adoption:\n AI isn’t a solo project. C-suite leaders should upskill, experiment and model lifelong learning. A leader must create a culture where tech fears are overcome, and AI is treated as a tool, not a threat.\n\n\n\n\nA truly AI-fluent C-suite isn’t just comfortable with AI—they’re confident wielders, navigating both potential and pitfalls while actively shaping what responsible adoption looks like.\n\n\nHow The Taplow Group Can Build an AI-Ready Leadership?\n\n\nThe Taplow Group is at the forefront of \nexecutive search\n and advisory, specializing in identifying, assessing, and developing AI-ready leaders.

Employing empathy functions as the key catalyst that supports enduring development and helps organizations maintain their best employees and thrive in the long run.\n\n\nPerformance extends beyond metrics into human interactions, which C-level executives and CEOs fully recognize.\n\n\nGlobal leaders now establish empathy as their fundamental workplace foundation because how does this element align with current executive strategies?\n\n\nScroll down & learn more about \nempathy in the workplace\n.\n\n\nWhat is Empathy?\n\n\nEmpathy serves no purpose by making people agree with others or being pleasant - it’s a myth.\n\n\nSimply put, it is the ability to put yourself in someone else’s shoes—to understand their feelings, perspectives, and struggles, even if you haven’t shared those experiences yourself.\n\n\nUnlike sympathy, which is feeling “for” someone, empathy is feeling “with” them. In the workplace, it’s that quiet pause before a decision, the willingness to listen to a subordinate’s ideas or the genuine concern for a colleague’s well-being.\n\n\nThe path to real \nempathy practice\n runs both ways and builds trust and collaborative relationships that extend across the entire organizational structure.\n\n\nRecommended Read:\n \nImportance of Effective Communication Planning and Execution\n\n\nWhy is Empathy Important in the Workplace?\n\n\nThrough empathy, organizations can remove organizational boundaries that improve both direct and honest evaluation between colleagues and allow teams to survive tense situations without descending into performance problems.\n\n\nHaving \nempathy as a leader\n gives a strategic advantage because research demonstrates that such organizations keep their people engaged while minimizing departures and developing more flexible, innovative teams.\n\n\nYou know the answer, right? How many times have organizations lost top talent, not because of pay, but because employees felt misunderstood or undervalued? Leaders who share empathy feel potential workplace issues in advance to resolve them before conflicts escalate.\n\n\nBig company leaders demonstrate \nempathy in the workplace\n that allows innovation to flourish across all situations. Workplace empathy serves as much more than ethical behaviour since it creates strong business advantages.\n\n\nHere are the \nways to improve emotional intelligence in the workplace\n with empathy.\n\n\nBenefits of Empathy in the Workplace\n\n\nThe business case for empathy goes far beyond warm and fuzzy feelings. Here are some of the most powerful benefits for global organizations:\n\n\n\n\nIncreased Employee Retention:\n Employees are more likely to stay with companies where they feel understood and supported. Empathy reduces turnover and the high costs of constant talent acquisition.\n\n\nBoosted Engagement and Productivity:\n When employees believe their voices matter, discretionary effort skyrockets. Empathy fuels motivation, ownership, and productivity.\n\n\nBetter Collaboration and Innovation:\n Diverse teams bring unique perspectives, but only empathy makes them work. By embracing and respecting differences, empathetic organizations tap into deeper wells of creativity.\n\n\nEnhanced Workplace Well-being:\n Empathy defuses conflict, reduces stress, and builds resilience, leading to fewer sick days and better mental health.\n\n\nSuperior Customer Experience:\n Organizations that cultivate internal empathy radiate it outward. Teams that practice empathy with one another are more likely to deliver truly customer-centric solutions.\n\n\nLeadership Impact:\n Empathetic executives and managers create a trickle-down effect, shaping a culture where high performance and humanity go hand in hand. It’s no coincidence that search consultants rate empathy high in CEO competencies, and \ninterim management services\n prioritize it for transformational roles.\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Read: \nInterim Executive Management - How Short-Term Leaders Drive Long-Term Results\n\n\nExamples of Empathy in the Workplace\n\n\nHere are a few real-life scenarios of how empathy looks like:\n\n\n\n\nLeading with Flexibility:\n A leader must be flexible towards their team members during times of crisis.\n\n\nActive Listening:\n A leader listens to every voice in the room and clarifies everything to make sure everyone understands.\n\n\nDiversity and Inclusion:\n Empathy inspires leaders to seek out and champion diverse perspectives. Instead of one-size-fits-all approaches, everyone’s background is seen as an asset.\n\n\nConflict Resolution:\n Leaders don't get involved in a clash; instead, resolve them with a safe space for dialogue and ensure all involved feel heard and find a win-win resolution.\n\n\nCorporate Initiatives:\n From wellness programs to ERGs (Employee Resource Groups), empathy inspires organizations to invest in what matters most to their people.\n\n\n\n\nEmpathy Training in the Workplace\n\n\nWhile some people are naturally more empathetic, empathy can definitely be learned, nurtured, and embedded within any organization’s DNA. Many leading companies are offering empathy workshops, role-reversal exercises, and leadership simulations as part of their \nCEO training program\n.\n\n\nRecommended Read:\n \nWhat skills are needed for an executive search consultant?\n\n\nHow Do Global Organizations Build and Sustain an Empathetic Culture?\n\n\n\n\nEmpathy Workshops:\n Organizations must streamline sessions where leaders and every other employee can learn how to be empathetic.\n\n\nCEO Training Programs:\n Organizations must have executive sessions to deliver deep understanding & compassion.\n\n\nInterim Management Services:\n Bringing in interim leaders skilled in emotional intelligence to “reset” the culture and showcase empathetic leadership in action.\n\n\nPeer Learning & Feedback:\n Creating circles for employees to share experiences and build trust.\n\n\n\n\nHow does The Taplow Group Help?\n\n\nIf your organization is serious about embedding empathy into your senior leadership and \nplanning and executing different types of messages\n, The Taplow Group is a world-class partner.\n\n\nAs a global leader in \nexecutive search consultant\n services and interim management, Taplow’s experienced advisors help organizations identify high-empathy leaders and develop empathy through tailored CEO training programs.\n\n\nBy benchmarking against the world’s best and offering hands-on guidance, The Taplow Group ensures your leadership pipeline is not only talented but truly transformative.

It matters because it fosters trust, improves communication, and creates a supportive work environment that boosts collaboration and productivity.\n\n\nQ: How does empathy benefit employee engagement and retention?\n\n\nA: Empathetic workplaces make employees feel valued and understood, which increases job satisfaction and loyalty. As a result, companies see higher retention rates and better overall engagement, reducing turnover costs significantly.\n\n\nQ: Can empathy in leadership improve team performance?\n\n\nA: Yes, leaders who practice empathy build stronger relationships with their teams, encourage open communication, and create psychologically safe spaces where employees take creative risks and perform at their best.\n\n\nQ: What are some common barriers to practicing empathy at work?\n\n\nA: Time constraints, competitive pressures, and a focus on results over relationships can hinder empathetic behavior. Also, some people may find it challenging to prioritize others’ emotions over their own in demanding work environments.\n\n\nQ: What are the five 5 key elements of empathy?\n\n\nA: The five key elements of empathy, as identified by psychologist Daniel Goleman and widely recognized in emotional intelligence frameworks, are:\n\n\n\n\nSelf-awareness:\n Understanding your own emotions and recognizing how they influence your thoughts and behavior. This foundation helps you be more attuned to others’ feelings.\n\n\nSelf-regulation:\n Managing your emotions effectively to respond thoughtfully rather than react impulsively, creating space to empathize sincerely.\n\n\nMotivation:\n Having the drive to act with empathy and prioritize relationships, which supports genuine care and engagement with others.\n\n\nEmpathy itself:\n The core ability to recognize, understand, and share the feelings of another person, seeing situations from their perspective without judgment.\n\n\nSocial skills:\n Using empathy to communicate effectively, build trust, manage conflicts, and collaborate harmoniously in social or professional settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2165)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

This is about creating a pipeline of leaders to ensure continuity, stability, and success for your business both now and in the future.\n\n\nWhy is Succession Planning Important?\n\n\nOrganizations that fail to prepare for looming leadership transitions put themselves at risk of costly disruption. It not only ensures business continuity, mitigates risk and reduces recruitment costs but also enhances employee morale.\n\n\nBenefits of Succession Planning\n\n\nSuccession planning is not simply a tick-box task — it is an investment in the long-term future of your organization. Here are the key benefits:\n\n\n\n\nMinimized Disruption:\n The transition of leadership is far easier, so business continuity is guaranteed even at different times.\n\n\nCost Efficiency:\n Internal promotions save costly recruitment and onboarding costs associated with external hires.\n\n\nUpskilled Workforce:\n Career Planning initiatives ensure that employees are continuously upgrading their skills.\n\n\nBoosted Morale:\n It gives them the sense that they could one day lead, and that makes employees feel valued—one of the best ways to boost engagement and retention in the workplace.\n\n\nFuture-Proofing:\n Succession planning is critical for a company to weather uncertainty and succeed in an evolving business climate.\n\n\n\n\nBest Practices for Succession Planning\n\n\n\n\nIdentify Critical Roles:\n Begin with the critical positions that, if vacancies were created, would impact operations. Think beyond just leadership—look at specialized and niche positions.\n\n\nAssess Your Talent Pool:\n Use data and performance reviews to assess employees’ potential. Watch out for high-performers who show potential for leadership.\n\n\nProvide Leadership Development Opportunities:\n This is the time to invest in mentoring, coaching, and \nleadership development\n programs for future leaders.\n\n\nPromote Internal Mobility:\n Nudge talent to seek opportunities outside the organization. Internal promotions boost loyalty and save on hiring.\n\n\nIntegrate with Business Strategy:\n Focus your succession plan on long-term business objectives for maximum impact and flexibility.\n\n\nUse Technology to Streamline:\n Use tools such as HR analytics, succession planning software, and learning management systems to streamline and improve the process.\n\n\nReview and Adjust Regularly:\n Set your succession plan to action.

It all comes down to corporate governance.\n\n\nAs the unseen structural foundation, corporate business governance stabilizes organizational decisions, organizational transparency, and organizational accountability.\n\n\nCompany governance serves businesses of all sizes, whether regional or international, by enabling them to function at optimal standards with ethical business practices that fulfill stakeholder requirements.\n\n\nWhat is Corporate Governance?\n\n\nA company receives direction through rules alongside practices and processes to achieve control. A business uses corporate governance as an operational guide to make decisions that protect every interest group, from shareholders to employees.\n\n\nCompanies' shareholders receive governance oversight from their board of directors, which is at the strategic center of corporate governance positions. A board of directors governs management while protecting its governance standards and ensuring that the company maintains proper direction.\n\n\nThe core elements of \nbusiness governance\n include accountability, fairness, and transparency, which create beneficial impacts on corporation structures and positive stakeholder connections with customers, suppliers, and investors.\n\n\nRecommended Read: \nTop 5 Change Management Models and Their Applications\n\n\nKey Models of Corporate/Business Governance\n\n\nA\n corporation and corporate governance\n are intertwined, with the latter providing the framework that directs how a corporation operates, makes decisions, and ensures accountability to its stakeholders.\n\n\nHere are some prominent \ncompany governance\n models:\n\n\nThe Anglo-American Model\n\n\nThis ownership approach stands as the standard format in both the UK and the USA since shareholders maintain priority. A governance structure based on this model relies on independent boards that monitor company managers to pursue market efficiency. It’s all about balancing shareholder profit and transparent reporting.\n\n\nThe Continental Model\n\n\nThe governmental structure of this framework operates in Germany and several European countries through separate boards consisting of management teams and supervisory boards. The supervisory board incorporates stakeholders, including labor representatives, to ensure partnership and enduring stability.\n\n\nThe Japanese Model\n\n\nWith its roots in stakeholder relationships, this model emphasizes keiretsu (business networks). Strong ties between corporations flourish, but transparency sometimes takes a back seat to loyalty and long-term growth.\n\n\nEach model evolves to fit the culture and economic conditions of its region, but the goal remains the same: \nsustainable \nbusiness governance\n.\n\n\nRead more: \nHow Communication Sector Consultancy Can Help Your Business?\n\n\nCorporate Governance Significance\n\n\nLet us break down the \ncorporate governance significance\n in today’s business environment:\n\n\nTransparency Builds Trust\n\n\nBusinesses thrive on trust. A company that regularly updates its stakeholders about financial risks and policy changes—builds confidence and attracts investors. This transparency comes directly from good corporate governance.\n\n\nFostering Ethical Decision-Making\n\n\nCorporate governance\n requirements consist of more than satisfying minimum standards because the practices should aim to be morally correct. The equal treatment of stakeholders under this model enables businesses to maintain responsible and ethical conduct.\n\n\nPerformance and Risk Management\n\n\nA business that lacks sufficient governance measures will likely develop into an unmanageable or corrupt entity. A sound governance system protects businesses from financial and legal risks and prevents harm to reputations.\n\n\nWe all love organizations that stand the test of time. Corporate governance helps them evolve responsibly while fostering long-term partnerships with stakeholders.\n\n\nThe Role of the Board in Company Governance\n\n\nThe board of directors is essential for sustaining proper governance systems. The director board develops policies to manage risks and leads financial health assessments of the company. A \nboard governance services firm\n works to establish independent boards that perform effectively by offering assessment and training functions for companies.\n\n\nThe modern global market has heightened corporate board diversity because organizations understand how fresh perspectives help their businesses thrive within competition. A firm's journey to business success hinges on enhancing its governing structure and integrating its risk management system with strategic planning for long-term objectives.\n\n\nThe Importance of Interim Management Services\n\n\nLife in a corporation doesn’t always go as planned. Sometimes, key leadership positions remain vacant unexpectedly, or businesses require transformation during periods of upheaval. In these cases, an organization needs \ninterim management services\n.\n\n\nRead More: \nInterim Executive Management - How Short-Term Leaders Drive Long-Term Results\n\n\nThese interim specialists bridge gaps and ensure businesses maintain operational efficiency even during transitions.

However, at the basic level, the job comes down to steering the organization and making sure every department is in line with that vision.\n\n\nHere are some of the everyday things CEOs do every day:\n\n\n\n\nCrafting and implementing high-level strategies.\n\n\nOverseeing company operations and monitoring key performance metrics.\n\n\nMaking significant business decisions, including approving annual budgets.\n\n\nRepresenting the company during public events or speaking to the media.\n\n\nManaging relationships with stakeholders, board members, and key executives.\n\n\n\n\n7 Key CEO Job Responsibilities\n\n\nSo, what are the \nresponsibilities of a CEO\n? Here’s a closer look:\n\n\n#1: Setting Strategic Vision and Goals\n\n\nA CEO is a company’s visionary who builds out its vision and long-term goals. They are measurable yet ambitious and ensure the company stays competitive and innovative in a constantly changing market.\n\n\nThey scan the horizon for opportunities, recognize potential threats, and prioritize initiatives to achieve sustainable growth. By showing strategic foresight, CEOs provide that sense of direction that can set the tone for the company’s ultimate success and instill confidence in investors, employees, and partners alike.\n\n\n#2: Leadership and Team Building\n\n\nThe people make or break any organization, and it is the CEO's responsibility to build and foster a high-level executive team.\n\n\nThey focus not just on hiring but also on collaboration and accountability and empower the leadership ranks, creating a shared sense of ownership and purpose.\n\n\n#3: Financial Oversight\n\n\nAlthough the CFO and finance teams manage daily financial operations, the CEO is in charge of macro-level resource allocation, investments, and budgeting.\n\n\nThe CEO has to be in touch with an understanding of financial results, stability, sustainability, shareholder value, and balancing growth with run-the-business efficiencies.\n\n\n#4: Shaping Organizational Culture\n\n\nThrough their actions, communication, and priorities, CEOs create the environment in which work is done and in which employees feel about their jobs.\n\n\nThe organization shows the foundation of an inclusive and collaborative culture in which innovation and employee well-being thrive. CEOs make sure that the values of the organization become not just words but things that are actionable and part of day-to-day operations and interactions.\n\n\n#5: Risk Management\n\n\nCEOs are on the frontline of risk navigation, protecting the organization from unexpected disruptions. Be it market shifts, regulatory nightmares, or economic downturns, they identify uncertainties and must develop mitigation strategies.\n\n\nCEOs must walk the line of both taking initiative and exercising caution so the company doesn’t suffer any damage to its reputation, finances, or operations.\n\n\n#6: Public Representation\n\n\nThe chief ambassador of an organization is its CEO. They maintain active contact with stakeholders, ensuring the company’s vision and strategy are expressed to everyone from investors to customers, partners to regulators.\n\n\nCEOs make media appearances, speak at industry events, and meet with shareholders — all to build trust, strengthen the brand, and attract opportunities. By living the company’s mission, a CEO is not just the image of the organization outside; they bring pride and togetherness within the workforce as well.\n\n\n#7: Driving Innovation and Adaptation\n\n\nFrom researching new technologies to promoting out-of-the-box thinking, CEOs make sure the company keeps its product relevant in ever-changing markets.\n\n\nThey foster a culture of adaptation by promoting an atmosphere where change is welcomed positively, ideas are tested without qualms, and Their vision fuels not just survival but market leadership for the long run.\n\n\nRecommended Read: \nMeet your new CEO through our CEO search services\n\n\nJob Description for CEO\n\n\nIf you were to skim a job description for a CEO, you would see a blend of strategic, operational, and leadership responsibilities.

But it's gratifying when you conquer obstacles and balance \nleadership and challenges\n.\n\n\nIf you are a leader of a global organization or a small team, you know this fact: leading a team is exciting but comes with significant challenges that aren't easy to crack.\n\n\nTo make it, you must know the \nchallenges of leadership\n and be ready to face them directly.\n\n\nScroll down until the end; we'll reveal how expert leadership advisory services can refine your leadership abilities.\n\n\nWhat is a Leadership Challenge?\n\n\nSimply put, a leadership challenge is all about any obstacle or difficulty that tests a leader’s ability to inspire, navigate & achieve results. These challenges are not roadblocks but an opportunity to elevate their impact & build a legacy.\n\n\n7 Common Leadership Challenges Faced by Modern Leaders\n\n\nBelow, we have listed seven significant \nleadership challenges examples \nso that you can be prepared for the road ahead:\n\n\n#1: Communication Breakdown\n\n\nWhat do you think is the \nbiggest challenge as a leader\n? It's failing to communicate.\n\n\nCommunication acts as the bond that keeps organizations intact. Lousy communication causes misunderstandings, waters down goals, and might even make the team disinterested.\n\n\nAs a leader, it's mandatory to maintain clear, brief, and steady communication. Develop active hearing and pick collaborative tools that suit everyone.\n\n\nAlso, always remember that good communication isn’t just about saying things out loud; it's about ensuring your point is understood.\n\n\n#2: Navigating Change\n\n\nThe mantra for leadership today is “Adapt or perish.” Rapid changes in markets, technologies, or team dynamics can topple unprepared leaders. This makes navigating change one of the \ncommon leadership challenges\n you simply can’t ignore.\n\n\nYou need flexibility to guide you through unsure paths. Welcome change by expecting challenges and shaping a culture that views change as a chance, not a danger. Being adaptable is a vital power every leader should develop.\n\n\nPro Tip: Prepare yourself with the \nkey leadership metrics\n to measure the impact of your leadership training.\n\n\n#3: Conflict Resolution\n\n\nManaging conflicts is tricky and demands significant solutions instantly. Unresolved issues disrupt teamwork, can drag down morale, and can build up multiple \nleadership difficulties\n that most people underestimate.\n\n\nYou must lead with empathy, encourage open dialogues and act as a mediator who looks for a common ground. Address conflicts promptly before they morph into more significant organizational problems.\n\n\n#4: Balancing Work-Life Expectations\n\n\nHere’s a hard truth: burnout isn't just a trendy term—it's a real danger for leaders who can't balance. The \nproblems of leadership\n often arise from mixing up \"work\" and \"life.\" And if you're exhausted, how can you energize your team?\n\n\nSet boundaries. You must be able to manage your time seamlessly and manage your work-life. When you care about yourself and your well-being, you set a healthy example for your team.\n\n\n#5: Inspiring Team Morale\n\n\nAsk anyone who is leading they will agree on a point that - motivating a team during tough times is the \ngreatest leadership challenge\n.\n\n\nIt is one of the major challenges as a leader because the morale of the team falls significantly during the times of distress.\n\n\nThe best thing you can do is to set an example by celebrating success. Big or small celebrate every win and make your team feel important. Putting resources into your team's success is the best way to boost commitment and loyalty.\n\n\n#6: Effective Decision Making\n\n\nDecisions, big or small, can make or break your leadership credibility. Sometimes, indecision is even worse than a bad choice—it paralyzes progress.\n\n\nThe key to overcoming this challenge as a leader is to rely on informed decision-making. Gather insights, weigh pros and cons, and most importantly, own the outcomes. The best leaders trust their instincts—but only after doing their homework.\n\n\n#7: Inclusive Leadership Amid Diversity\n\n\nIn this wide-ranging world, fostering inclusivity is essential, not just a pleasant gesture. An inclusive leader welcomes a mix of ideas and actively creates opportunities for every team member. However, effectively navigating diversity ranks among the most demanding challenges for leaders.\n\n\nAlso Read : \nExecutive search firm: Overview, How it works, Benefits & More\n\n\nYou’ll need to foster an environment of safety and respect. Recognize biases, make inclusion part of company values, and set a precedent starting from the top. When everyone feels a sense of belonging, your team can’t help but thrive.\n\n\nWhat Are Leadership Advisory Services?\n\n\nEven the most proficient leaders hit the wall, and they need expert \nleadership advisory services\n to navigate the uncharted terrain.\n\n\nThey offer customized solutions to boost your leadership skills, tackle your most complex \nleadership issues\n, and fill talent shortages in your team.\n\n\nIf you're dealing with issues like crisis handling, planning for future leadership, or significant changes, this is the help you didn't realize you needed.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, we offer strategic leadership training that can help you navigate crisis management, succession planning, and strategic transformation with ease.

On the other hand, good leadership fosters innovation, increases morale, and drives results.\n\n\nA leader is a motivating force for individuals who can effectively influence processes. Grasping \nleadership effectiveness\n proficiency matters, whether at the helm of a vast enterprise or merely guiding a small team.\n\n\nDive into \nwhat constitutes effective leadership\n and how to sharpen your skills.\n\n\nWhat is Effective Leadership?\n\n\nMicromanagement is not \neffective leadership\n, and once a true leader inspires, guides, and equips their subordinates, it becomes evident. It requires vision, adaptability, decision-making, emotional intelligence, and execution of a plan.\n\n\nCommanding a military ship through a hurricane exemplifies how a good leader maintains order in an organization that is chaotic.\n\n\nFrom top business advisors globally, good leadership is also defined as aligning employees to corporate goals. These pointers constitute \nleadership effectiveness meaning\n in empowering organizational culture and provide some of its benefits, which are productivity, engagement, and team member retention.\n\n\nRecommended Read: \nImportance of Effective Communication Planning and Execution\n \n\n\nWhat Constitutes Effective Leadership?\n\n\nAgile leadership relies on specific traits that make good leaders stand out from the rest. Some of these include: \n\n\n\n\nVisionary Thinking:\n Effective leaders strategize by defining specific objectives and working towards achieving them.\n\n\nAdaptability:\n \nA key to effective leadership is the ability to\n stay on track to complete goals while creatively working around unexpected roadblocks. \n\n\nEmpathy:\n Leaders require a fair amount of emotional intelligence to help them relate to the team and foster a healthy level of trust. \n\n\nDecisiveness:\n Undoubtedly, thinking through and promptly acting on the tough decisions at hand is essential.\n\n\nCommunication:\n Active listening and clear expression of thoughts are invaluable in closing communication gaps.\n\n\n\n\nThe Role of Situational Leadership\n\n\nEver wonder why some leaders excel in versatile scenarios?

This method allows them to really meet the needs of each person and situation they deal with.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group (a leading \nglobal executive search\n firm), we help you build situational leadership to address varying needs effectively and strengthen leadership relationships.\n\n\nSituational leadership proves that a single solution for all doesn't work.\n\n\nHow to Be an Effective Leader: Expert Tips and Techniques\n\n\nOnce familiar with the prime attributes of a leader, the forthcoming query is: \nhow to be an effective leader\n? To guide you in skill enhancement, here are some researched suggestions: \n\n\n\n\nContinuous Learning:\n Like any other skill, leadership requires practice. You can develop this by reading, attending seminars, and keeping up with the latest in your professional area.\n\n\nPractice Empathy:\n Get to know your team deeply. It helps a lot. Too much control slowly leads to a loss of trust.\n\n\nDelegate Wisely:\n Trust your team and empower them with responsibility. Micromanaging erodes trust over time.\n\n\nEndeavor to Communicate More Effectively:\n Talking and listening well is key in leadership.\n\n\nSeek Feedback:\n Good leaders learn from slip-ups.

This will build a strong bond with your team. Give full attention to understanding concerns or feedback without jumping to conclusions.\n\n\nIf you consistently practice this \nstrong leadership\n technique, you will improve your effectiveness as a leader and be able to address what your team truly needs.\n\n\n#2: Implement SMART Goals\n\n\nSetting SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals provides your team with a clear path and understanding.\n\n\nEmploying this method is pivotal for syncing actions with your overarching aims as a leader. Breaking more significant initiatives into smaller, prioritized steps moves everyone forward with focus and purpose.\n\n\n#3: Practice Situational Leadership\n\n\nSituational leadership empowers leaders to tweak their approach depending on the situation.\n\n\nYou must customize your leadership style to ensure that you’re meeting people where they are.\n\n\nThe \ncharacteristics of situational leadership\n includes flexibility, adaptability, and the ability to assess team needs dynamically.\n\n\n#4: Provide Regular Feedback\n\n\nFeedback is like fuel—it powers motivation and alignment (but only if done right). If you want to boost your team’s performance faster, then you must provide regular, constructive feedback.\n\n\nBe specific with your feedback. Beyond addressing concerns and celebrating achievements—positive reinforcement is as necessary as corrective input.\n\n\n#5: Lead by Example\n\n\nIt might seem straightforward, but setting an example is a highly effective leadership method. If you expect honesty, accountability, and diligence from your team, exemplify these traits daily.\n\n\nSteadiness in your actions resonates more profoundly than any motivational talk. Show them that you’re doing it first. It’s the ultimate trust-building exercise.\n\n\nThe Taplow Group: Your Partner Building Strong Leadership\n\n\nEvery leader occasionally needs external guidance to truly excel.

And the burning question is, what are the current recruitment trends? We have surveyed this internally and have nine hiring trends from the experts at The Taplow Group.\n\n\nThe list is below; check it out.\n\n\n9 Talent Acquisition Trends You Must Know to Drive Success\n\n\n#1: AI in Hiring\n\n\nExecutive Recruiters are utilizing \nAI hiring trends\n report a significant jump in quality hires. With tools that can scan resumes, review applicanats, and even assist schedule interviews, AI is making hiring faster.\n\n\nAI hiring tools also help lower unconscious bias by emphasizing objective data. Let us not overlook, nevertheless, the elephant in the room: transparency. Candidates want to know how AI impacts their applications, so ethical implementation is key.\n\n\n#2: Skills-Based Hiring\n\n\nA degree is no longer the “golden ticket”. Global organizations are embracing skills-based hiring, and for good reason. Today’s recruitment focuses on what candidates can do, not just where they studied.\n\n\nWhy? It diversifies the talent pool and ensures hiring decisions are based on ability, not just fancy credentials. In fact, this approach improves employee retention—candidates hired for skills over degrees stick around 34% longer.\n\n\nSo, if you’re still evaluating candidates by traditional resumes, maybe it’s time to reboot. Learn about \nwhat is an executive search consultant\n & consult them to enhance your recruitment strategies.\n\n\n#3: Employer Branding\n\n\nThink about it: would you apply to a company with bad reviews on Glassdoor? Probably not. Candidates prioritize company culture, work-life balance, and growth opportunities as much as salaries.\n\n\nTo enhance your employer brand, consider implementing professional development initiatives like a \nCEO Training program\n. This not only showcases your commitment to leadership growth but also reflects positively on your organizational culture.\n\n\nAlso read: \nCEO Training: 5 Ultimate Benefits of Leadership Training\n\n\nEmployee testimonials, authentic social media presence, and clear diversity values can attract top talent. Build a strong employer brand, and watch your recruitment process become smoother.\n\n\n#4: Data-Driven Hiring\n\n\nGut instincts are so last decade—data is the MVP of current hiring trends. With advanced analytics, companies can identify hiring trends, anticipate workforce needs, and predict turnover risks.\n\n\nPredictive analytics also help widen candidate pools by highlighting nontraditional fits that might be overlooked. Companies using data-driven methods report a 78% increase in the quality of hires. Need any more reasons to get on board?\n\n\n#5: Diverse and Inclusive Hiring\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) are not optional; they are fundamental. Why is that? Diverse teams have been shown to be more innovative and creative. Compaines have established that companies with high gender diversity outperform their competitors.\n\n\nModern candidates actively look for organizations that promote inclusivity. Reviewing job postings and removing bias from hiring processes could make your company stand out in a crowded market.\n\n\n#6: Recruitment Automation\n\n\nChatbots and other recruitment automation tools quickly become central to hiring strategies. With a click, you can automate hundreds (or even thousands) of CVs or schedule interviews.\n\n\nBeyond saving time, automation tools ensure a better candidate experience. Prospects love chatbots' responsiveness, and hiring teams love how automation gives them more time to focus on relationship-building.\n\n\n#7: Flexibility \n\n\nWorking from home is no longer a perk; it’s practically expected. As of March 2025, about 64% of global organizations have adopted hybrid work models, and job seekers love them.\n\n\nCandidates ask for flexibility; companies that listen see 20% higher employee satisfaction rates. But if you have strict or rigid return-to-office policies, you may scare top talent away.\n\n\nHave you thought about it? Is your organization ready to embrace flexibility?\n\n\n#8: Generational Hiring Preferences\n\n\nRecruiting strategies aren’t “one size fits all,” especially with multiple generations in the workforce. Candidates from Generation Z seek sustainability, meaningful work, and workplace flexibility. Boomers prioritize employment security and benefits, while millennials are concerned about mentoring and career advancement.\n\n\nCustomizing your hiring strategies (including benefits packages) to fit various generations draws the appropriate talent and helps create a workplace that benefits all. After all, accommodating generational diversity is a smart move for long-term success.\n\n\n#9: Employee Value Proposition (EVP) is the Key\n\n\nNo perks can attract today’s candidates as much as the organization’s culture, responsiveness, and support can. Today, it is all about offering a work-life balance where each employee feels a part of your organization without getting overburdened by the work itself.\n\n\nLearn \nhow to measure leadership development\n within your organization and ensure your EVP is effective. This can be done through various metrics such as employee engagement scores, feedback mechanisms, and retention rates.\n\n\nIf your culture is not part of your employee experience, you may lose your top talents (without significant reason). As rightly said, “In the era of AI and automation, unique human experiences are leading the way.”\n\n\nAdapt as Per These Recruitment Trends or Get Left Behind\n\n\nThe employment sector is changing; maintaining pace is not negotiable. Adopting these trends guarantees top talent and helps your business to be a leader in the 2025 \nrecruitment industry trends\n. At The Taplow Group, our \nexecutive search consultants\n help you develop robust hiring strategies, that anticipate future challenges and position your organization for long-term success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (1675)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

In today’s fast-paced business environment of rapid changes in leadership, it is very much required to help organizations prepare and pave the way for a proper and smooth leadership transition.\n\n\nA \nboard governance services firm\n like ours will come in handy to help you with your organizational executive succession planning, and our seasoned experts shall help you smooth leadership transitions. After all, the adaptation and flexibility of your organization's new generations of leaders determine its future.\n\n\nExpert Insights for Strategic Executive Succession Planning\n\n\nInsight 1: A Future-Forward Mindset\n\n\nStrategists refer to planning for the future as the most essential component of effective succession planning. Experienced strategists also report that organizations should always be on the lookout for future leaders, considering what future challenges and opportunities will be.\n\n\nBy structuring a proactive approach, you protect against unprepared positions and set the stage for steady growth. Adopting this mindset resembles keeping a weather forecast handy, allowing you to prepare for the unavoidable storms in your business journey.\n\n\nInsight 2: Embrace Data-Driven Decisions\n\n\nData is the unsung hero of successful succession planning. In a time when every decision can be quantified, using data-driven methods guarantees that your planning is objective and decisive.\n\n\nWith analytics and metrics of leadership potential, you may accurately identify the persons ready to occupy significant positions in your company. Applying this method improves the objectivity of the assessment and the trust within the organization that it creates, reflecting the degree of transparency and allies that become credible bridges for transition.\n\n\nInsight 3: Balancing Objectivity with Empathy\n\n\nWhile numbers and models are essential, don’t forget the human element. Succession planning isn’t solely about evaluating performance metrics but recognizing potential through empathy.\n\n\nHaving an empathy-driven approach is part of understanding the players, their future endeavors, how they develop personally, and the feelings of the future leaders. In the present competitive job market, showing the candidates that they are acknowledged, respected, and understood is necessary.\n\n\nInsight 4: Integrated Leadership Development\n\n\nCompanies that are determined to be open to learning and self-development differentiate themselves from their competition.\n\n\nTreating \nleadership development\n through courses, peer mentoring, or coaching leads to enhanced and better-equipped potentials who can take on executive duties. Doing this establishes a culture in which talents are grown, gratified, and constantly improved.\n\n\nInsight 5: Clear Accountability & Transparency\n\n\nToo many roles that lack clarity and complicated processes, especially regarding succession planning, lead to problems like confusion. Everyone must know what they are expected to do, namely selecting successors and deciding on their readiness to take on much more complex tasks.\n\n\nWhen there is transparency and distinctness in the knowledge transfer, employees are more comfortable knowing their secure future. Thus, a very enthusiastic employee force is created. This pinpoint is the key to successful planning, and not having it can result in conflicts or misplaced possibilities.\n\n\nInsight 6: Harnessing Technology and Communication Advances\n\n\nLeveraging innovative communication tools and analytics platforms can significantly enhance the success of your succession planning efforts. For \ntechnology and communication sector consultancy\n organizations, using digital tools to track, analyze, and project leadership progress is a natural choice.\n\n\nIntegrating technology within your operational framework results in receiving real-time data, easy access to data, and communication channels that ensure everyone is kept in the loop. This digital advantage equips you with a potential competitive advantage that guarantees the conformity of your succession planning to the pace of modern-day business and its responsiveness and flexibility.\n\n\nInsight 7: Engaging External Expertise\n\n\nAt times, getting an outsider's view is precisely what you need. By reaching out for assistance from external specialists, you can gain an objective evaluation, which is rather challenging to obtain internally. Professional consultants can help enhance your personnel selection, assessment, and development processes by ensuring that the succession planning is strong enough to stand independently.\n\n\nThey provide strategic guidance, share known practices, and assist in customizing your process to suit your company’s vision and culture. Even the most thorough endeavors can fail to spot important areas for enhancement without outsourcing such outside expertise.\n\n\nBuild a Sustainable Leadership with The Taplow Group\n\n\nAccurate executive succession planning does not occur at one moment but is a multifaceted and ongoing process.\n\n\nFor those who want their companies' succession planning system to reflect their businesses, the best part would be to have a collaborative relationship with the specialists who understand the situation, as in all its complexity, the stakes are high. At \nThe Taplow Group\n, our experienced professionals always strive to support organizations and leaders in resolving complex issues of executive succession.\n\n\nWe are the partner you can trust in the construction of the leadership of tomorrow, using a unique set of techniques and providing you with the personal support you need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (1220)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

In this competitive world, leaders are expected to inspire teams, make complex decisions, and evolve constantly with the pace.\n\n\nHowever, it would not be right to say that individuals are born great leaders. People can learn, refine, and develop themselves to be great leaders. This is where they need executive coaching.\n\n\nExecutive coaches prepare business leaders individually to enhance their capacity to handle challenges and complex situations within an organization seamlessly.\n\n\nFor such leaders, especially those in high-stakes roles like CEOs, fine-tuning their capabilities isn’t an option—it’s a requirement. The \nCEO training program\n that consulting firms provide is merely an add-on to the resource.\n\n\nUnderstanding Executive Coaching\n\n\nExecutive coaches are expected to develop a formal, goal-driven approach to attending to business executives' personal and professional development.\n\n\nAn executive coach doesn’t train leaders “how to lead.” Instead, it should help them become more self-aware and develop emotional intelligence, which allows them to reflect more deeply on their actions and decisions.\n\n\nA business executive will need to view a coach as a mirror. They reflect the leader’s actions, communication style, and decision-making habits while showing them the areas needing improvement. As a result, individuals become highly aware, efficient, and confident leaders who can empower their teams and drive organizational success.\n\n\nRole of Executive Coaching in Leadership Development\n\n\nExecutive coaches are not mentors in a traditional sense; they are strategic partners who seek to comprehend a leader’s strengths and weaknesses on a deeper level. An executive coach helps improve particular habits and areas that must be worked on.\n\n\nHave you ever worked with someone who seemed unreachable yet delivered excellent results? Coaches help transform such raw potential into refined greatness.\n\n\nOne important function of an executive coach is helping leaders manage change, conflict, and decision-making. With many organizations shifting rapidly, adaptability seems to have become the grail of leadership.\n\n\nExecutive coaches ensure that leaders not only know how to make decisions but are also able to manage crisis situations and control diverse groups of people—these are some necessary elements of \nglobal executive search\n services.\n\n\nKey Benefits of Executive Coaching\n\n\nIf you think executive coaching is only a luxury for senior leaders, think again. It’s a game-changer for leaders at any level, delivering several key benefits:\n\n\nEnhanced Self-Awareness\n\n\nSelf-awareness is one of the most impactful benefits of professional coaching. Leaders become more aware of their impacts on employees, the organization, and external stakeholders.\n\n\nImproved Communication Skills\n\n\nHave you ever thought about why some leaders inspire others so simply? It’s communication. Coaches help leaders master the art of messaging by teaching them how to listen, empathize, and persuade others.\n\n\nStrategic Thinking and Emotional Intelligence\n\n\nToday’s leaders need to make tough decisions while showing empathy and having a vision for the future. Strategic myopia is no longer acceptable; it involves directing what to do next without thinking long-term.\n\n\nConfidence and Executive Presence\n\n\nWhen a leader walks into the room, people notice their energy—an unspoken authority that comes from confidence and executive presence. Coaching helps leaders exude this persona naturally.\n\n\nBetter Team Management\n\n\nOutstanding leadership is nothing without a high-performing team. Coaches focus on fostering collaboration, trust, and motivation within teams.\n\n\nSkills Developed Through Executive Coaching\n\n\nExecutive coaching is not just about “being a better boss.” It’s about acquiring and refining several essential skills, including:\n\n\nConflict Resolution:\n Leaders learn how to address interpersonal issues constructively without disrupting team dynamics.\n\n\nAdaptability:\n With industries evolving, staying agile is critical. Executive coaches teach methods for handling uncertainty and change, such as pros.\n\n\nEmpathy Development:\n Leaders are trained to listen, understand employee concerns, and handle sensitive situations.\n\n\nHow Leadership Consulting Firms Elevate the Coaching Process\n\n\nCoaching at an individual executive level is impactful, but when combined with the capabilities of \nleadership consulting firms\n, it becomes mind-blowing. Why? Such companies focus on leader assessment, organizational culture, and other peculiar problems within the domain, which enables them to assist with coaching in a more rounded manner.\n\n\nFor example, they can identify specific coaching gaps and subsequently design coaching programs particular to those gaps, which helps ensure that leaders continue to function beyond their immediate responsibilities to larger ones.\n\n\nElevate Leadership Potential with The Taplow Group\n\n\nIn leadership development, executive coaching is the missing puzzle differentiating good leaders from great ones.\n\n\nHere at The Taplow Group, we focus on facilitating improvement in leadership for those who need guiding hands through executive coaching. Infusing years of experience with leadership consulting, our specialists implement best-suited strategies for positive development.\n\n\nFrom CEO training programs to general leadership development programs, our team ensures leaders are positioned correctly for the challenges of now and the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (1362)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

In total, 64 countries and the European Union—representing nearly half of the world’s population—went to the polls. These elections brought significant governmental shifts, leading to policy changes with far-reaching impacts on employment and the workforce.\n\n\nAs these legislative transformations take effect in 2025, this report—crafted by our partners working within their respective regions—delivers a comprehensive analysis of economic, employment, and social trends shaping the year ahead.\n\n\n \n\n\nASIA\n\n\nAustralia\n\n\nAustralia is set for a national election in 2025, with all \nStates and Territories\n heading to the polls.\n\n\nAs of \n30 June 2024\n, Australia’s population reached \n27,204,809\n, reflecting a \n2.1% annual increase\n. This growth was driven by a \nnatural increase of 106,400\n and \nnet overseas migration of 445,600\n.\n\n\nThe economy continued its \n12th consecutive quarter of growth\n, with \nGDP rising 0.3% in the September quarter\n, primarily fueled by \ngovernment spending and public capital investment\n. However, overall economic growth for the year stood at \n0.8%\n, the slowest pace since the \nCOVID-19 downturn in late 2020\n. In seasonally adjusted chain volume terms, GDP grew \n0.3%\n, while nominal GDP rose \n0.4%\n. The \nterms of trade declined by 2.5%\n, and the \nhousehold savings-to-income ratio\n increased from \n2.4% to 3.2%\n.\n\n\nIn December 2024, the unemployment rate remained at 4%, and the participation rate held steady at 67.1%. Employment increased to 14,573,800, whilst the employment-to-population ratio remained at 64.4%.\n\n\nSource Australian Bureau of Statistics \n\n\nThe Australian cash rate target is 4.35 per cent and the interest rate paid on Exchange Settlement balances is 4.25 per cent.\n\n\nUnderlying inflation remains too high; however, inflation has fallen since its peak in 2022.  Measures of underlying inflation are around 3½ per cent, which is still some way from the 2.5 per cent midpoint of the inflation target.\n\n\nOutput growth has been weak. National accounts for the September quarter show that the economy grew by only 0.8 per cent over the past year. Outside of the COVID-19 pandemic, this is the slowest pace of growth since the early 1990s.\n\n\nPast declines in real disposable income and the ongoing effect of restrictive financial conditions continued to weigh on household consumption spending, particularly on discretionary items.\n\n\nChina\n\n\nChina's economic outlook for 2025 indicates a slowing growth rate, with most analysts predicting a GDP expansion of around 4.5%, primarily due to weak consumer demand, a struggling real estate market, and potential impacts from US tariffs, with concerns about further economic stress and potential for public dissent if growth continues to weaken.\n\n\nKey points about China's 2025 economic outlook:\n\n\nSlower Growth:\n\n\nMost experts anticipate China's economic growth to slow down further in 2025, with predictions of around 4.5% compared to previous years.\n\n\nConsumer Demand Concerns:\n\n\nWeak consumer spending is seen as a major risk to the economy, impacting retail sectors and overall economic activity.\n\n\nReal Estate Market Challenges:\n\n\nOngoing issues in the real estate sector, including declining prices and high debt levels, are a significant concern.\n\n\nGovernment Stimulus Measures:\n\n\nThe Chinese government is expected to implement further stimulus policies to counteract the slowdown, including potential monetary easing.\n\n\nTrade Tensions:\n\n\nPotential impacts from US tariffs could further dampen economic growth.\n\n\nIndia\n\n\nIndia’s Economic Outlook for 2025\n\n\nThe Indian economy demonstrated remarkable resilience in 2024, recording a GDP growth rate of approximately 7%, despite global uncertainties. This performance was bolstered by continued government investments in infrastructure and manufacturing, positioning India as a key global production hub through initiatives such as ‘Make in India’ and ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’. The re-election of the Modi government in 2024 further strengthened market confidence, with investors anticipating sustained economic reforms and policy continuity.\n\n\nAs India enters 2025, the outlook remains bullish, even as major global institutions like the World Bank and IMF predict a slowdown in global growth. With regional conflicts affecting economies worldwide, India continues its steady march toward becoming a $5 trillion economy by 2027-28 (Economic Times).\n\n\nGDP Growth Forecast for 2025\n\n\nIndia is projected to grow at 6.6% in 2025, making it the fastest-growing major emerging market, ahead of China and Brazil. In contrast, the OECD has forecasted global GDP growth at 3.2% (Economic Times).\n\n\nJob Market Outlook\n\n\nIndia’s labour market remains resilient despite challenges related to rising unemployment and a skills gap. According to the ManpowerGroup Employment Outlook Survey, hiring sentiment for Jan-March 2025 is 15 percentage points above the global average. The top five hiring sectors for 2025 are:\n\n\n1.        Information Technology (IT)\n\n\n2.        Financial Services & Real Estate\n\n\n3.        Consumer Goods & Services\n\n\n4.        Energy & Utilities\n\n\n5.        Healthcare & Life Sciences (ManpowerGroup Survey, Economic Times)\n\n\nInflation & Monetary Policy\n\n\nHeadline inflation is projected to average 4.2% in 2025, with food inflation declining to 4.6% due to adequate rainfall and a strong summer crop yield. Analysts expect India’s central bank to cut interest rates by 25 basis points in early 2025, while remaining cautious about inflationary pressures (Goldman Sachs Insights).\n\n\nStock Market Outlook\n\n\nAccording to Goldman Sachs Research, India’s equities are expected to perform strongly in the medium term, with the NIFTY projected to reach 27,000 by end-2025. Growth will be driven by high-performing sectors such as automobiles, telecommunications, insurance, real estate, and e-commerce (Goldman Sachs Insights).\n\n\nLong-Term Economic Prospects\n\n\nDespite short-term challenges, India’s medium-term outlook remains robust. The country is on track to become the world’s third-largest economy within five years, trailing only behind the U.S. and China (Economic Times). As India continues transforming into a global economic powerhouse, it is poised to emerge as a key driver of global growth in the coming decade.\n\n\nNew Zealand\n\n\nEconomic Outlook for New Zealand \n\n\nNew Zealand’s economy faced significant challenges in 2024, with widespread consensus among economists that the year can largely be written off as a period of contraction and stagnation. Preliminary data suggests that GDP likely shrank by 0.1%, marking a challenging year for the nation. However, a brighter economic outlook is forecast for 2025, with expectations of a gradual recovery driven by monetary easing, improved domestic conditions, and stabilising financial markets.\n\n\n2025: Signs of Recovery\n\n\nDespite the headwinds of 2024, 2025 is expected to mark the beginning of a recovery. The ANZ’s latest economic outlook forecasts modest GDP growth of 1.1% for the year, supported by the RBNZ’s accommodative monetary policies. Interest rates are projected to fall significantly, with the official cash rate (OCR) expected to reach 3.5% by mid-2025 (currently 4.25%). This reduction will lower borrowing costs, ease credit conditions, and stimulate domestic demand.\n\n\nThe stabilisation of house prices and a softer New Zealand dollar are also likely to support improved financial conditions. These developments, coupled with falling debt-servicing costs and recovering real incomes, should drive a cyclical upswing in consumption and investment. Firms are expected to ramp up capital expenditure, addressing project delays from prior years.\n\n\nKey Challenges\n\n\nWhile the recovery is promising, it is not without risks. Labour market conditions are expected to deteriorate further in the year's first half, with unemployment peaking at 5.5% before gradually declining. Globally, the economic policies of Donald Trump’s newly elected U.S. administration are anticipated to create additional uncertainty. Increased protectionism in the U.S. could weaken global demand, indirectly affecting New Zealand’s export-reliant sectors.\n\n\nLooking Ahead: 2026 and Beyond\n\n\nWhile 2025 is forecast to deliver modest growth, the recovery is expected to gain momentum in 2026, with GDP growth projected to accelerate to 3%. By then, the combination of lower interest rates, improved labour market conditions, and normalised monetary policies should provide a stronger foundation for sustained economic expansion.\n\n\nSingapore \n\n\nAfter a year of slowdown and uncertainty in 2024, Singapore’s economy is expected to grow moderately in 2025, with the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) forecasting GDP expansion between 1% and 3%. While trade-related sectors and modern services will continue to drive recovery, global geopolitical uncertainties and a stronger Singapore dollar may challenge exports.\n\n\nEconomic recovery will be supported by monetary easing, stabilising global demand, and resilient domestic consumption. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is likely to adjust its exchange rate policy, easing pressure on trade-driven industries. Growth is expected to be led by financial services, technology, and green sectors while moderating inflation and lower interest rates should boost consumer spending and business confidence.\n\n\nHowever, external risks remain a concern. A slower-than-expected recovery in China and the U.S. and ongoing trade disruptions could impact Singapore’s open economy. The labour market may tighten, particularly in sectors reliant on foreign talent, while businesses navigate higher operating costs and evolving regulations.\n\n\nLooking ahead, 2026 is expected to bring stronger momentum, with GDP growth projected at 3%, driven by private sector investment, digital transformation, and sustainability initiatives. As Singapore adapts to a shifting global trade landscape, it remains poised to reinforce its role as a financial and innovation hub in Asia.\n\n\n \n\n\nAMERICAS\n\n\nBrazil\n\n\n2024 Brazilian Economy\n\n\nBrazil's GDP growth reached 3.1% in 2024 (Oct. 2023 - Sept. 2024), with forecasts indicating a slowdown to 2.0% in 2025. The 2024 inflation rate underperformed at 4.83%, against a target of 3.00%, with similar projections for 2025 at 4.20%.\n\n\nThe Central Bank of Brazil reduced SELIC rates from 11.75% to 10.50% during the first three quarters but raised them to 12.25% in the fourth quarter of 2024 to combat currency devaluation, which reached 26.38% due to excessive government spending.\n\n\nUnemployment decreased to 6.4% in October 2024, with the workforce reaching 100.7 million. Brazil maintains its position amongst the top 10 global economies, with a GNP exceeding US$ 2.13 trillion.\n\n\nFollowing the success of PIX, Brazil's instant payment system, the Central Bank plans to introduce 'Drex' in 2025—a blockchain-based digital currency designed to secure financial transactions through a unified platform, operating independently from traditional banking systems.\n\n\nCanada \n\n\nCanada faces significant economic challenges in December 2024, with the federal deficit reaching $61.9 billion, exceeding targets by 50%. Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland's resignation and potential 25% US tariffs under President Trump's return create economic uncertainty. The Bank of Canada has responded by lowering interest rates to 3.25%.\n\n\nDespite these challenges, growth sectors are emerging. Air Canada projects 36% revenue growth by 2028, whilst the hydrogen industry has attracted $100 billion in investments across 80 low-carbon projects.\n\n\nThe government is adjusting immigration policies, reducing permanent resident targets from 485,000 to 395,000 in 2025 to address housing pressures. Meanwhile, the TSX shows continued strength, supported by rising metal prices and favourable interest rates.\n\n\nThe primary concerns remain the impact of potential US tariffs on Canada's export-driven economy, particularly affecting automotive, agriculture and natural resource sectors. However, the emergence of clean energy projects and aviation sector growth provide positive counterbalance for economic outlook.\n\n\nUSA\n\n\nThe U.S. economy enters 2025 cautiously optimistic, as all business sectors show some improvement despite ongoing volatility. Variable remuneration, including annual and long-term bonuses, remains difficult to attain, with many companies struggling to meet board-mandated performance targets. Business failures have surged, reaching nearly 20% in some sub-markets, underscoring persistent economic pressures.\n\n\nThe new Trump administration has reignited its “Make America Great Again” economic agenda, focusing on deregulation, tax cuts, and domestic industry growth. While these policies aim to boost job creation and stimulate investment, they also introduce uncertainty in global trade relations and potential shifts in monetary policy. Companies remain cautious, awaiting more precise signals on trade agreements, tariffs, and corporate tax structures.\n\n\nAdding to the complexity, recent severe weather events, particularly in California, have disrupted supply chains and economic stability. This, combined with market reactions to Trump’s economic and foreign policies, has fueled volatility beyond U.S. borders, impacting global financial markets.\n\n\nDespite these headwinds, economic resilience remains strong, driven by consumer spending, technological advancements, and steady employment. If pro-business policies successfully stimulate domestic manufacturing and infrastructure investment, 2025 could mark the beginning of renewed economic expansion. However, businesses must remain agile in navigating policy shifts and global market dynamics.\n\n\n \n\n\nEUROPE\n\n\nBulgaria\n\n\nGDP growth is forecast to accelerate from 2.4% in 2024 to around 3% in 2025 and 2026, supported by domestic demand and exports. The expansion in income is set to underpin robust private consumption growth.\n\n\nThe unemployment rate remained low amid limited labour shedding in the manufacturing sector, offset by intensive hiring in the public sector and services.\n\n\nIn 2025, inflation is set to abate to 2.3%, benefiting from negative energy inflation and low industrial goods inflation, as well as from base effects from the price hikes in tourist services in 2024. Headline inflation in 2026 is expected to edge up, driven by services inflation. \n\n\nDenmark\n\n\nDenmark’s Economic and Business Landscape in 2025\n\n\nDenmark's 2025 economic outlook shows strong stability, with GDP forecast to grow by 2.9%. The economy is bolstered by a robust pharmaceutical sector, led by Novo Nordisk's success, and significant renewable energy projects, including the North Sea Energy Island initiative.\n\n\nThe country maintains one of Europe's lowest unemployment rates, though this creates recruitment challenges, particularly in specialised fields. Public debt remains well-managed at 25.1% of GDP, with a government surplus of 1.4%.\n\n\nKey regulatory changes for 2025 include updated salary thresholds for foreign workers and a new Bookkeeping Act mandating digital systems. The pharmaceutical sector contributes nearly 5% to GDP, whilst renewable energy projects advance Denmark's ambitious 70% emissions reduction target by 2030.\n\n\nDespite challenges in the labour market and the need to adapt to new regulations, Denmark's focus on innovation, particularly in life sciences, renewable energy, and digital technologies, positions it favourably for continued growth and investment opportunities.\n\n\nFrance\n\n\nEconomic forecast for France\n\n\nFrance's GDP growth is forecast to slow to 0.8% in 2025, primarily due to fiscal adjustment, though supported by monetary policy easing. The government deficit is expected to reach 6.2% of GDP in 2024 before declining to 5.3% in 2025, while public debt is projected to increase to 117% of GDP by 2026.\n\n\nDomestic demand will be the main growth driver in 2025, with private consumption supported by disinflation and real wage increases. However, private investment is expected to remain subdued due to economic uncertainty.\n\n\nThe labour market shows signs of softening, with employment growth slowing to 0.1% in 2025 and unemployment rising slightly to 7.5%. Inflation is projected to ease to 1.9% in 2025, remaining below the ECB target.\n\n\nThe government has introduced a significant fiscal package in its draft budget, including revenue-increasing measures worth €21.6 billion (0.7% of GDP), aimed at reducing the deficit while managing the increasing public debt burden.\n\n\nFinland\n\n\nThe Bank of Finland forecasts the economy will contract by 0.5% in 2024 before growing by 0.8% in 2025 and 1.8% in 2026, settling at 1.3% in 2027. Consumer spending recovery will be initially slow due to weak confidence and rising unemployment, though expected interest rate reductions should provide support.\n\n\nThe investment outlook is mixed, with non-residential investment increasing in 2025, while residential construction recovery will take longer. Exports are expected to improve gradually from 2025, though growth may be constrained by subdued euro area performance and potential US trade policy changes.\n\n\nInflation will remain below 2% throughout the forecast period. Despite government fiscal adjustment measures, the public deficit will reach 4% of GDP in 2024, not falling below 3% until 2027. The public debt ratio is projected to rise to 87% by 2027, indicating an unsustainable debt accumulation path with a 2% sustainability gap.\n\n\nGermany\n\n\nGermany's 2025 economic outlook projects minimal growth (less than 1% or negative), influenced by ongoing energy challenges, inflation above 2%, and structural industry changes.\n\n\nThe energy transition away from Russian gas and nuclear power has led to higher costs, while the automotive sector struggles with the shift to electric vehicles. The country faces multiple challenges: investing in green technology, digitalisation and defence while managing budgetary constraints. Construction, real estate and infrastructure sectors are particularly affected.\n\n\nLabour shortages persist due to an ageing population, despite low unemployment. Wage pressures continue to contribute to inflation risks.\n\n\nAs a major exporter, Germany is working to diversify its trade relationships and supply chains amid geopolitical tensions with China and the US. The economic recovery depends mainly on the successful management of industrial transformation and energy transition, alongside effective political measures to address these challenges.\n\n\nItaly\n\n\nReal GDP is expected to grow by 0.7% in 2024, supported by investment and falling imports. Economic activity is set to expand by 1% and 1.2% in 2025 and 2026, respectively, as consumption picks up and RRP-related spending accelerates. Inflation is forecast to drop to 1.1% this year, rise to 1.9% in 2025 and fall slightly again in 2026.\n\n\nThe phase-out of sizeable housing tax credits and buoyant revenue are expected to push the government deficit significantly down in 2024 to 3.8% of GDP. The deficit is forecast to fall further in 2025 and 2026, just below 3% of GDP.\n\n\nEmployment is expected to increase by 1.6% this year, after 1.9% in 2023, and to decelerate further in 2025-26. As job opportunities continue to improve, the increase in labour market participation is set to outpace the projected decline in working-age population over the forecast horizon. The unemployment rate is thus set to decrease to 6.2% in 2026\n\n\nNorway\n\n\nGNP AND INTEREST RATES\n\n\nWith 5.5 million inhabitants, Norway maintains a strong economy with a per capita GNP of €80,400 and total GNP of €437 billion, showing a 1.4% increase over the past year. Inflation stands at 2.9%, while unemployment remains low at 3.6%.\n\n\nInterest rates have held steady but are expected to decrease by 0.5-1.0% through 2025. Consumer confidence has improved slightly, though private consumption remains below government targets. The real estate market continues to struggle post-COVID-19, affecting the construction industry.\n\n\nWhile imports remained stable in 2024, exports grew, particularly seafood. The energy sector, including oil, gas, wind, and hydro, remains crucial to Norway's economy. Financial returns have been modest despite significant investment in environmental-friendly energy initiatives, including battery factories.\n\n\nA general election in September 2025 will bring political changes based on recent polling trends.\n\n\nSpain\n\n\nSpain’s growth is expected to surpass the eurozone average as Caixa Bank Research projects a 2.3% growth for Spain in 2025, compared to an estimated 1.3% for the eurozone driven by robust domestic demand and sustained investment recovery. According to recent forecasts, the Spanish economy is expected to experience solid growth in 2025, with a projected GDP increase ranging from 2.1% to 2.5%. The Bank of Spain anticipates a 2.5% rise, while BBVA estimates a 2.1% growth.\n\n\nThis growth will primarily be driven by domestic demand, with private consumption and investment playing key roles.\n\n\nInvestment\n\n\nInvestment will be another growth driver, particularly in equipment goods and construction. The Chamber of Spain estimates a 3.4% increase in investment in equipment goods and a 3% increase in construction investment, supported by favourable financing conditions and the implementation of European funds. However, investment remains the most delayed variable in recovering to pre-pandemic levels. Gross Fixed Capital Formation reached 99.6% of Q4 2019 levels by Q3 2024, showing a lag in equipment goods.\n\n\nMonetary Policy and Credit\n\n\nThe European Central Bank's (ECB) monetary policy will influence financing conditions. An interest rate reduction of -100 basis points in 2024 and at least -75 basis points in 2025 is anticipated. This scenario will facilitate the deleveraging of companies and households.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nSpain's economic outlook 2025 appears favourable, with projected growth rates exceeding the European average, driven by robust domestic demand and sustained investment recovery.\n\n\nSweden\n\n\nSweden's 2025 major policy changes include significant budget increases across key sectors:\n\n\n\n\nJustice system: SEK 86.7 billion (+SEK 3.46 billion) for crime prevention and gang violence\n\n\nDefence: SEK 138 billion (+SEK 13 billion, 10% increase)\n\n\nInfrastructure: SEK 200 billion increase in transport\n\n\nResearch: SEK 6.5 billion boosts by 2028 for innovation\n\n\n\n\nThe government has implemented stricter asylum and citizenship policies while maintaining its commitment to net-zero emissions by 2045 through industry electrification and transport sector transformation.\n\n\nThe labour market shows regional variations, with northern Sweden benefiting from green investments while metropolitan areas expect slower recovery.\n\n\nKey growth sectors for 2025:\n\n\n\n\nRenewable energy (wind, hydro, biomass)\n\n\nE-commerce and digital platforms\n\n\nHealthtech (telemedicine, digital health records)\n\n\nFintech (mobile payments, digital banking)\n\n\nGaming and e-sports\n\n\nSustainable construction with a focus on new materials and automation\n\n\n\n\nThese initiatives reflect Sweden's focus on security, sustainability, digital transformation, and economic growth while addressing social challenges.\n\n\nUK\n\n\nUnited Kingdom: Economic Outlook for 2025\n\n\nThe UK economy enters 2025 with mixed signals, as GDP growth is projected at 1.7%, supported by fiscal expansion, while inflation remains elevated at 2.4%. Interest rates are expected to gradually decline to 4.00%, offering some relief to businesses and consumers. However, ongoing trade friction and global economic uncertainties may dampen external demand.\n\n\nThe newly elected Labour government has introduced sweeping employment law reforms, marking one of the most significant shifts in recent years. Key changes include “day one” protection against unfair dismissal (effective autumn 2026), expanded statutory rights for sick pay, parental leave, bereavement leave, and maternity protection. New restrictions on “fire and rehire” practices, guaranteed hours for zero-hours contracts, and compensation for cancelled or shortened shifts add further compliance requirements for employers. Additionally, businesses must now provide reasonable justification for rejecting flexible working requests.\n\n\nThe labour market faces ongoing challenges, with talent shortages persisting in healthcare, the public sector, manufacturing, and financial services. Changes to employers' National Insurance contributions are prompting companies to reassess hiring strategies, with increased reliance on interim management expected in the first half of 2025.\n\n\nWhile these labour market reforms bring greater worker protections, they also add complexity for employers navigating an economy still grappling with inflationary pressures and trade uncertainties. The coming year will test the resilience of businesses as they adapt to regulatory changes while seeking growth in a shifting economic landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (1524)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

One wrong turn in hiring can send you down a difficult path.\n\n\nBeing in this business for more than 2 decades, hiring people on the basis of their potential and experience is the key to success in this competitive world. \n\n\nScroll down and learn about those smart hiring strategies curated by our top \nexecutive search consultants\n. And as you read, remember a wise investor once said, “Hire slow and fire fast,” but with these insights, you’ll know exactly when to prioritize quality over speed.\n\n\n7 Smart Recruitment Strategies for Hiring Right Candidates\n\n\nDefine Your Hiring Strategy\n\n\nA period of strategic planning is necessary before creating job ads. You need to think, “What does your organization demand now & what is the futuristic vision”?\n\n\nThe main issue among startup founders appears when they hire candidates impulsively to fill empty positions, disregarding long-term business effects immediately. A clearly defined hiring strategy sets the foundation for a robust talent pipeline. This means outlining your ideal candidate’s skills, experience, and cultural fit.\n\n\nPrioritize Quality Over Speed\n\n\nHiring with speed remains an essential requirement in startup culture due to rapid work rates. Quick employment choices could result in obtaining applicants who are not exactly suitable for the role.\n\n\nBad hiring costs financial expenses, reduced team spirit, project stoppages, and hindered expansion prospects to the organization. Companies should avoid hasty recruitment approaches by adopting structured interviews alongside scoring rubrics and strategic hiring procedures. This approach can reduce the risk of mishiring by up to 70%.\n\n\nLeverage Data-Driven Assessments\n\n\nData functions as a helpful resource in the current digital times. Use evaluation methods that analyze technical abilities combined with soft competencies that include critical thinking ability and creativity while measuring emotional intelligence.\n\n\nCandidates emerge with a complete profile through practical assessments, behavioral screening, and cognitive ability evaluations. This means decisions are based on sound predictors of success rather than mere intuition or bias.\n\n\nBuild a Flat Organizational Structure\n\n\nStartups often benefit from a flat or horizontal structure. Such setups empower employees to take ownership of projects, make decisions swiftly, and contribute ideas without the constraints of a strict hierarchy.\n\n\nIn an environment where everyone can voice opinions, you naturally cultivate a culture of innovation and trust. This means you’re not just hiring employees but grooming future leaders who understand your company’s dynamics and can drive rapid growth forward.\n\n\nPlan for Future Needs\n\n\nThe pressing nature of present-day work demands often drives people to overlook upcoming workplace requirements. The process of smart hiring requires more than immediate vacancy filling to take on today's needs because organizations require strategic planning to fill upcoming positions.\n\n\nMap out potential leadership roles, invest in training, and even consider forward hiring strategies. Integrating initiatives like a \nCEO training program\n can prepare your internal candidates for leadership roles. This kind of foresight ensures that your company adapts and scales efficiently as demands shift.\n\n\nEmbrace Inclusivity & Reduce Bias\n\n\nThe recruitment process should be focused on selecting team members from different backgrounds because diverse teams yield multiple viewpoints that lead to improved outcomes. Establish uniform interview procedures that help defend candidates from subconscious bias and enable proper unbiased assessments.\n\n\nThe selection process becomes more inclusive if interview panels use diverse member pools and if resumes remain anonymous. The organizational environment that includes every member while respecting their sense of value drives creative problem-solving through dynamic resolution.\n\n\nOptimize Recruitment & Onboarding\n\n\nYour recruitment process extends beyond issuing an offer to candidates because it remains active even after you find the ideal selection. New employees must immediately succeed after joining the organization because a carefully thought-out onboarding initiative plays a critical role.\n\n\nThis means clear job descriptions, mentoring, and even structured onboarding schedules that last for 12 weeks or more. Consider implementing strategies that encourage peer-to-peer feedback and continuous learning. And don’t forget to incorporate \nindustrial professional recruitment\n techniques to cater to specialized roles as needed.\n\n\nRecruit Smartly with The Taplow Group\n\n\nSmart hiring is a journey, not a destination. By prioritizing quality over speed, leveraging data-driven tools, building inclusive teams, and planning for future growth, you create an environment where every hire is a building block to lasting success.\n\n\nWith a deep understanding of industry trends, access to top-tier talent, and a personalized approach, our executive search professionals at \nThe Taplow Group\n ensure that every hire aligns perfectly with your organization's long-term vision.\n\n\nAs you continue your journey, remember that a balanced approach, coupled with ongoing learning and adaptation, is the key to smart hiring that stands the test of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (1252)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

C-suite leaders must now blend time-tested strategies with new-age skills that are not only technical but, crucially, human-centric. \n\n\nScroll and learn about the most essential skills that modern C-suite executives should master.\n\n\nExpert Skills to Look for in Future C-Suite Executives \n\n\nAdaptability & Resilience\n\n\nFor an effective leader, adaptability and resilience function as essential characteristics. Rapid transformations in the business environment mean these leaders must adjust quickly through major developments like economic slowdowns and disruptive technologies.\n\n\nLeaders with both adaptability and resilience will bend in situations that could harm them while becoming stronger through facing difficulties. These leadership qualities enable C-level executives to prosper and survive in uncertain conditions.\n\n\nDigital & Tech Savviness\n\n\nThe effectiveness of C-suite leadership requires executives who understand complicated decision-making systems, AI, and futuristic technologies equally well as they do traditional organizational discussions during meetings.\n\n\nThey must break down the complex nature of technology for their teams by implementing digital tools that increase productivity throughout all organizational levels. The contemporary strategy helps organizations outpace their competitors and sponsor an environment of continuous development and innovation through their workforce.\n\n\nEmotional Intelligence & Empathy\n\n\nLeaders need strong emotional intelligence skills to thrive in the present age. A leader's ability to directly understand and build meaningful relations with employees and stakeholders marks the true difference between excellent leaders and competent ones.\n\n\nIn the present digital era, which disconnects people from each other, leading with empathy and clarity supports both office morale and builds partnerships with outside contacts. Through a proper combination of intellectual and emotional understanding, leaders successfully motivate their teams to achieve maximum results.\n\n\nVisionary Communication\n\n\nClear, strategic, and visionary communication also plays a vital role in the success of future C-suite executives. A compelling vision serves as their leadership trademark by connecting employees' roles to significant goals.\n\n\nOrganizations that desire long-term success need effective communication to function as their fundamental source of life.\n\n\nData-Driven Decision Making\n\n\nA comprehensive communication strategy must be combined with data-driven decision-making support for success during digital times.

An organization-wide culture of curiosity and continuous improvement emerges from leaders who choose to remain students of life, because this attitude keeps them well informed.\n\n\nThe Role of Interim Executive Management\n\n\nAnother emerging trend on the horizon is the strategic utility of \ninterim executive management\n. Leadership by replacement allows organizations to preserve order during times of transition coupled with quick changes.\n\n\nInterim executives bring their experienced methods alongside their new viewpoints to support organizations when their regular leadership teams transition toward future structure.\n\n\nSo, what does this mean for organizations aiming to build effective leadership teams for tomorrow?

The key to maximizing these differences isn’t simply efficient team management—it's about mobilizing varied strengths for organizational achievements.\n\n\nThe Generational Landscape\n\n\nUnderstand the key generations shaping the workforce today:\n\n\nBaby Boomers (1946-1964)\n\n\nThis segment comprises seniors who value classic hierarchies and in-person communication. Their leadership style typically embodies dedication, determination, and corporate loyalty. \n\n\nBaby boomers have seen major economic ups and downs and key technological shifts and have invaluable experience & expertise to offer.\n\n\nGeneration X (1965-1980)\n\n\nAccording to a leading \ntechnology and communication sector consultancy\n, Gen X leaders exhibit strong independence and entrepreneurial spirit.\n\n\nThey excel at bridging the gap between traditional and modern leadership approaches, valuing both structure and flexibility. Their adaptive nature makes them particularly effective in managing diverse teams.\n\n\nMillennials (1981-1996)\n\n\nThe Millennial generation is an advanced & technological generation. They prioritize teamwork, growth, knowledge, and purpose-driven work.\n\n\nTheir leadership method often spotlights the nurturing of uniqueness while nurturing an inclusive workspace where each voice counts.\n\n\nGeneration Z (1997-2012)\n\n\nThe latest additions to the workforce offer a fresh outlook on leadership evolution. They combine digital fluency with a strong desire for stability and meaningful impact.\n\n\nTheir style of leading tends to highlight transparency, social accountability, and incorporation of technology.\n\n\nBridging the Generational Gap\n\n\nEfficient leadership across generations necessitates an adaptable strategy:\n\n\nCommunication Adaptation\n\n\nEach generation has distinct communication preferences. While Baby Boomers might prefer formal meetings, younger generations often favor digital channels.\n\n\nThe key is providing multiple communication channels to ensure everyone stays connected and engaged.\n \n\n\nLeveraging Diverse Strengths\n\n\nSmart leaders recognize that generational differences can be organizational assets. A good example would be synergizing tech-adept Millennials with wise Baby Boomers in projects, as it could foster potent learning opportunities.\n\n\nThis strategy doesn't just amp up team performance but also encourages intergenerational understanding.\n\n\nFlexible Management Approaches\n\n\nThe 2025 workplace demands adaptable leadership styles. Research shows that organizations embracing flexible management approaches see up to 20% higher productivity levels.\n\n\nThis might mean combining traditional structures with modern collaborative tools to create an environment where all generations thrive.\n\n\nTips to Create an Inclusive Leadership Culture\n\n\nTo build truly effective multigenerational teams:\n\n\nFoster Open Dialogue\n\n\nCreate spaces where different generations can share perspectives openly. This might include regular team discussions about working styles and preferences. Such conversations help break down stereotypes and build mutual understanding.\n\n\nImplement Mentoring Programs\n\n\nTwo-way mentoring programs where generations learn from each other can be particularly effective. While senior leaders share industry expertise, younger team members can offer insights into emerging technologies and trends.\n\n\nFocus on Individual Strengths\n\n\nWhile understanding generational differences is important, avoid stereotyping. Each team member brings unique qualities regardless of their generation. The best leaders recognize and nurture individual talents while being mindful of generational influences.\n \n\n\nLooking Ahead\n\n\nEmbracing generational diversity is the future of leadership. As underlined in the latest studies, businesses that successfully bridge generational discrepancies witness improved innovation, comprehensive problem-solving skills, and deepened team unity.\n\n\nMoving forward, leaders must:\n\n\n\n\nContinuously adapt their management styles to meet evolving workforce needs.\n\n\nCreate inclusive environments that value diverse perspectives.\n\n\nInvest in training programs that help leaders navigate generational differences effectively.\n\n\n\n\nBest Practices for Success\n\n\nRegular Assessment\n\n\nRegularly evaluate your leadership approach and its effectiveness across different generations. Use feedback mechanisms to understand what works and what needs adjustment.\n\n\nTechnological Integration\n\n\nWhile maintaining traditional communication channels, incorporate digital tools that facilitate collaboration across generations. This balanced approach ensures that everyone feels comfortable and productive.\n\n\nProfessional Development\n\n\nInvest in ongoing \nleadership development\n training to understand and navigate generational differences. This might include workshops on communication styles, conflict resolution, and team building across age groups.\n\n\nTrust The Taplow Group for a Resilient Leadership\n\n\nThe secret to effective multigenerational leadership doesn’t lie in uniform treatment but rather in recognizing and valuing the different perspectives that each generation carries.\n\n\nHere at The Taplow Group, our advisors strategize and construct formidable and resilient teams for your organizations.\n\n\nRemember - age has no relevance to skillful leadership. To lead effectively, one must be understanding, adaptable, and capable of bringing out the best in each team member - irrespective of their generational background.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2795)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "Executive's Guide to Turn Quiet Quitters into High-Performing Team\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nSaturday, January 25, 2025\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might have experienced this situation when someone works physically but remains mentally detached from their job - It’s the worst experience!\n\n\nYou detect their withdrawal so faintly it escapes notice. Employees stop engaging mentally even though they continue their work on the job. That's what quiet quitting is.\n\n\nIn reality, organizations lose momentum when key people disengage. Down here, we’ll explore how leaders can re-engage these quiet quitters and turn them into high-performing team members.\n\n\nUnderstanding Quiet Quitting and Its Effects on Teams\n\n\nQuiet quitting typically involves employees who aren’t physically leaving their jobs but have emotionally signed off. They remain invisible while completing only tasks that get the work done without interference.\n\n\nThey show up to acknowledge work requirements but stay distant from genuine responsibility for their duties. The presence of these individuals slowly erodes teamwork morale, which spreads to affect everyone on the team.\n\n\nKey Reasons Behind Quiet Quitting\n\n\n#1. Lack of Recognition\n\n\nEmployees often begin to withdraw when their achievements go unnoticed. If people feel like another cog in the machine, they might forget why their contributions matter.\n\n\n#2. Unclear Goals\n\n\nEmployees need specific performance goals to recognize their daily work's link with the business direction; otherwise, they drift without motivation.\n\n\n#3. Limited Growth Opportunities\n\n\nWhen staff members cannot advance past their current positions, their achievements stop developing. Their development gets locked in as they struggle to grow in limited space, just like plants in a small pot.\n\n\n#4. Inadequate Leadership\n\n\nA micromanager or an absent leader can inadvertently push employees to shut down. Effective leadership is crucial in preventing disengagement.\n\n\n#5. Work-Life Imbalance\n\n\nEmployees who are constantly stretched thin eventually lose the passion and energy they once brought to the job, resulting in mental distancing.\n\n\nImpact on Organizational Performance\n\n\nWhen team members mentally tap out, productivity declines, and innovation stalls. Projects might limp along, but they rarely thrive.\n\n\nOver time, this hidden lack of engagement can reduce morale, prompt higher turnover, and tarnish your organization’s reputation as a desirable place to work.\n\n\nFor leaders looking to grow their organizations or enhance their \nindustrial professional recruitment\n pipeline, quiet quitting can be a silent killer of organizational success.\n\n\nKey Strategies to Turn Quiet Quitters into High-Performing Team\n\n\n#1: Communication and Trust\n\n\nOpen dialogue is the starting block for any solution. When leaders encourage honest conversations, employees feel safe expressing concerns.\n\n\nSetting up regular one-on-one sessions and team huddles not only fosters bond-building but also clarifies daily tasks and long-term objectives. Trust grows when leaders exhibit transparency—even if the news isn’t always rosy—because straightforward communication signals respect for employees’ intelligence and autonomy.\n\n\n#2: Empowering Leadership\n\n\nLeadership style can make or break a team’s spirit. When leaders stand by their team, offering support and freedom instead of micromanagement, employees have room to shine. Think of a coach who trains athletes to trust their instincts while guiding from the sidelines.\n\n\nThis sense of empowerment encourages employees to take ownership of projects, generating ideas and solutions that benefit the bigger picture. When personal agency aligns with collective goals, individuals move from quiet indifference to motivated commitment.\n\n\n#3: Career Growth and Development\n\n\nFrom skill-building workshops to mentorship programs, investing in your team’s development can reignite waning enthusiasm. Imagine an ambitious employee stuck doing the same tasks for years—eventually, they’ll switch to auto-pilot.\n\n\nBy mapping out a career path, offering training opportunities, or tapping into \nexecutive interim management services\n to cultivate a leadership mindset, employees start seeing a bright future with the organization. They become more than just seat-fillers; they transform into innovators who consistently elevate their standards.\n\n\n#4: Recognition and Inclusive Culture\n\n\nWorkplace culture sets the tone for how employees perceive their roles. A simple “thank you” or acknowledgment in a team meeting can flip someone’s day entirely. And it doesn’t stop with verbal praise—leaders can implement peer recognition initiatives or reward systems that showcase contributions.\n\n\nThis inclusive environment doesn’t just highlight top performers; it emphasizes that every role is essential. By valuing each person’s input, you encourage an environment where no one wants to fade into the background.\n\n\nIf you want to align leaders with potential new hires or candidates through \nCEO search services\n, fostering such a culture ensures that future hires join an engaged and vibrant workforce.\n\n\n#5: Work-Life Balance\n\n\nOffering remote work options or flexible scheduling can radically boost morale. Employees who feel suffocated by rigid structures will be the first to check out mentally.\n\n\nWhen staff members are given the freedom to manage personal and professional responsibilities effectively, they often reciprocate with loyalty and dedication. Opportunities for rejuvenation help maintain high energy and productivity, reducing the likelihood of quiet quitting.\n\n\nKey Metrics and Evaluation\n\n\nTo gauge whether efforts are bearing fruit, leaders should track metrics like employee turnover, project completion rates, and performance reviews.\n\n\nTake regular feedback and shed light on ongoing engagement levels. If something hasn’t improved, pause, chat with your team, and refine your strategy.\n\n\nAs you monitor these touchpoints, you’ll be better positioned to make data-driven decisions that protect morale and strengthen organizational resilience.\n\n\nWrapping Up\n\n\nQuiet quitting may be a gradual drain on your organization’s energy, but with proactive leadership, you can steer your team back toward meaningful engagement.\n\n\nAt \nThe Taplow Group\n, our consultants from across the world experience this challenge in their routine and navigate numerous leaders and organizations toward success.\n\n\nRemember, work culture is shaped not just by organizational charts or official policies but also by everyday interactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (1724)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "7 Things CEOs Must Do to Accelerate their Team's Performance\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nWednesday, January 22, 2025\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 3.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA CEO's contribution to team productivity has turned more intricate yet more vital than ever.\n\n\nInspiring a team to operate at their full capacity isn't just about strategy—it's about embracing a leadership mindset. An effective, high-functioning team doesn’t merely reach goals—it surpasses them.\n\n\n7 Things CEOs Must Do to Boost Team’s Performance\n\n\nHere are seven essential actions that every CEO must take to accelerate their team’s performance:\n\n\n#1: Define and Share a Clear Vision\n\n\nAs the CEO, articulating your organization's objectives and building a consistent understanding among the team is part of your duty. A well-structured vision can invigorate the team and inspire action with clarity and intent.\n\n\nMake communicating your vision an ongoing practice—in meetings, documents, or private chats—to keep everyone acutely receptive to their part in realizing the broader goal.\n\n\nA precise roadmap empowers individuals to make performance-centric decisions without constant supervision.\n\n\n#2: Foster a Culture of Accountability\n\n\nWithout accountability, even the most skillful team might fail to meet expectations. Accountability fosters ownership over roles and responsibilities.\n\n\nEmploy structures like OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) to provide a framework that assures every team member is pursuing quantifiable objectives. As CEO, motivate your time leaders for regular progress review—away from the fear of criticism—understanding obstacles and scopes for enhancement.\n\n\nBecoming transparent in leadership and having the courage to answer for your actions sets an example for your team, too.\n\n\n#3: Prioritize High-Quality Communication\n\n\nOne of the biggest challenges many CEOs face is the breakdown of communication across different layers of the organization. To prevent this, you must focus on fostering an information-sharing culture that bridges silos and sparks collaboration.\n\n\nWhether it’s hosting regular team meetings or town halls, scheduling one-on-one check-ins, or simply investing in cutting-edge communication tools, seamless conversation should become an ingrained habit.\n\n\nAs a CEO, you must be committed to listening. Vital insights often come from the employees confronting real challenges daily. Allocate time for actively listening to your team’s worries, suggestions, and ambitions.\n\n\n#4: Invest in Continuous Learning and Development\n\n\nCreating opportunities for skill development through training, mentoring, and exposure to different experiences is vital for their growth—and the success of your company.\n\n\nAs an organization, you can consider a \nCEO training program\n for your senior leaders. This not only hones their decision-making and leadership capabilities but also demonstrates your commitment to personal growth across the organization.\n\n\nOrganizations that continuously invest in learning build teams that are agile, innovative, and ready to adapt to external changes—qualities that directly contribute to long-term success.\n\n\n#5: Embrace Technology and Simplify Processes\n\n\nWhile the latest tools and platforms can supercharge performance, they can also overwhelm employees if not carefully implemented. As a CEO, your role is to introduce technology strategically—to enhance productivity without adding unnecessary complexity.\n\n\nTools like AI-powered analytics or project management platforms not only improve workflows but also empower your team to make data-driven decisions.\n\n\nWhen your team knows the exact steps to take, they can focus on delivering value rather than navigating unnecessary layers.\n\n\n#6: Cultivate a Positive and Inclusive Culture\n\n\nCulture sets the tone for how employees interact, innovate, and execute. As a CEO, it’s your role to shape and nurture a positive and inclusive culture that is aligned with your organization’s values.\n\n\nA great culture doesn’t mean enforcing rigid policies. Instead, it can be as simple as creating a flexible work environment, celebrating achievements, and ensuring equal opportunities for career advancement.\n\n\nIncorporating a habit of recognition, like writing personal thank-you notes or celebrating milestones during meetings, can make employees feel valued.\n\n\n#7: Harness the Power of Hiring Right\n\n\nRecruitment is arguably one of the most significant levers you have for accelerating team success—and working with \nglobal executive search services\n can help you build a team of A-players suited for your mission.\n\n\nA team member who embodies shared values and understands your work ethic will naturally amplify performance.\n\n\nInvest quality time in hiring. Evaluate not only an applicant’s technical abilities but also their outlook, versatility, and harmony with your company’s culture. As your firm grows, onboarding proper talent matching your existing team will be beneficial both regarding performance and innovation.\n\n\nGet Professional Help from The Taplow Group\n\n\nEvery CEO knows the pressure to deliver results. However, the best leaders recognize that truly accelerated team performance is about building a foundation of trust, clarity, and opportunity.\n\n\nAs an organization, if you’re doing purposeful hiring through a professional \nleadership consultant\n to implement effective practices, remember this: the most successful CEOs are the ones who align their team’s success with their vision.\n\n\nLead with purpose—and the results will follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (1806)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "AI has Risen, Is Your Leadership Ready for the Big Change?\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nMonday, January 20, 2025\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou hold a leadership position in your organization, and it would be unfair to say that you are not familiar with the continuous shifting of the business environment.\n\n\nAI has become a transformative technology that is shaking the evolutionary foundations of organizations, introducing innovation, and communicating with the target market.\n\n\nLeadership consulting firms\n like us are already warning leaders to prepare by flopping. But the question remains: Is your leadership ready for the big change that AI brings?\n\n\nThe AI Revolution is Here\n\n\nHowever, for the best businesses, AI has already arrived—and it is forcing sharper practices than ever before.\n\n\nThus, in 2025, we are observing a shift away from the perceivable growth of end-to-end First-Generation AI systems. Instead, there is a growing focus on more complex constructs involving autonomous agents, encompassing both First- and Second-Generation AI systems. This revolutionary process moves from conventional automation to intelligent ones capable of learning, optimizing, and deciding in the flow.\n\n\nFor leaders, this implies that the old way of thinking is not effective anymore. A new flexible and social kind of leadership is emerging from a rigid authority-based model of leadership in business. \nCommunication sector consultancy\n firms are already starting to see the competitive pressures that AI has brought to the customer experience through chatbots and virtual assistants.\n\n\nBut AI is not just about the tool but the person. Innovation management is a dismounted innovation focused on the culture of learning, experiments, and improving innovation. AI keynote speaker Alex Goryachev says, “The organizations that are doing the best job with AI now aren’t using a perfect map of where AI is heading in the future – they’re taking action today, experimenting, failing, and learning.”\n\n\nThe Leadership Imperative\n\n\nThat begs the question: Who can lead an AI environment?\n\n\nIt involves a high level of technical knowledge and the effects of technology on organizational operations and general society. Supervisors must be able to sort reality from the buzz, determine where AI can provide useful improvements, and devise a plan to achieve this.\n\n\nBut that's not all. Leaders should also be ready to promote collaborative working between their employees and AI systems. Alum relationship management fosters a positive organizational culture that engenders trust, openness, and learning that impels employees’ innovation, autonomy, and skill building.\n\n\nAI constantly transforms the environment in which organizations operate, and leaders must be ready to change to succeed. This is because leadership in today’s complex world calls for innovation, vagueness, and effective use of personnel skills.\n\n\nThe AI-Ready Leader\n\n\nSo, what does an organization look like if it is ready for an AI?\n\n\nThey are curious and eager to know more and better. They are also not afraid of risks and the unknown. They are quite familiar with the concept of uncertainty and learn how to make the best decisions within conditions that are often rather close to unpredictable.\n\n\nAI-ready leaders are conceptual thinkers who can see where AI may be valuable and how to incorporate it into an organization. They are multidimensional and flexible, enhancing mobility or being cross-functional and cross-divisional as they create new products and services.\n\n\nMost importantly, AI-ready leaders are people first, meaning they understand that the use of AI tools is not a substitute for human decision-making, artistic skills, and passion. They know that AI is an enabler and not a replacement for human capital, and therefore, it is about growing the people in organizational teams.\n\n\nThe Human Touch: Why Leadership Matters More Than Ever\n\n\nThe arrival of AI might make it seem like human leadership is less important, but this isn’t the case.\n\n\nA leader's ability to relate to people, inspire confidence, and focus on the big picture is even more critical in AI-dominated industries. By taking on AI as a partner, you can reduce operational complexity and turn your attention toward innovation and human connection.\n\n\nThe Future of Leadership\n\n\nAs AI increases and becomes enhanced, it is unclear how the leadership will look. However, one thing is clear: I refined this idea using “evolve” when warning leaders that this paradigm will ensure that those who do not evolve will be left out.\n\n\nIt may take time, but the organizations that will continue to grow and evolve will put people at the center of new technological advancements like AI and are cognizant of its weaknesses.\n\n\nBuild Future-Ready Leadership with The Taplow Group\n\n\nAs the saying goes, \"The best way to predict the future is to create it.\"\n\n\nAI is a wake-up call to leaders around the world. By challenging the great AI opportunity, supporting humane directions, and cultivating people's capabilities and potential, leaders can successfully adapt to the big change.\n\n\nBut how do organizations ensure these? They need experts and professionals who can lead them throughout. At the Taplow Group, our \ninterim management services\n \nand leadership training programs ensure that organizations get their desired leadership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (1412)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Yet, amidst this tech-driven transformation, one truth remains clear: the value of human expertise in leadership cannot be overshadowed.\n\n\nExecutive search consultants\n at the Taplow Group are always here to help. Connect with our professionals for future-ready leadership.\n\n\nBlending Technology with Human Connection: Why Now?\n\n\nTechnology has turbocharged how leaders operate. Leaders can now analyze massive datasets in seconds, spot patterns in customer behavior, and even automate workflows to free up time for high-value discussions and creative problem-solving.\n\n\nBut here's the catch: Technology cannot entirely replace human intuition, creativity, or empathy. It lacks the “human touch” that inspires teams, builds trust, and fosters collaboration. Employees look to leaders for guidance, understanding, and inspiration during uncertain times—not solely for data-backed directives.\n\n\nAt the heart of successful leadership lies emotional intelligence. Leaders must use technology to enhance—not diminish—their connections with their teams.\n\n\nThe Power of Human Expertise in Oversight\n\n\nAs mechanical processes and virtual intellects increasingly influence workplace choices, leaders are tasked with one of paramount importance - the ethical and responsible utilization of these advanced tools.\n\n\nLeaders have to establish themselves as the virtuous overseers of technology applications, confirming that essential decisions about employment coincide with organizational beliefs. This ethical oversight cannot be outsourced to an algorithm; it requires careful human expertise and judgment.\n\n\nForward-thinking companies are already realizing this. \nLeadership development management services firms\n are investing heavily in training programs that teach leaders how to incorporate both big-picture thinking and ethical considerations within a tech-driven strategy.\n\n\nCreating a Culture of Collaboration with Technology\n\n\nTechnology can dramatically improve workplace collaboration—but only if the culture supports it. Hybrid work models, for instance, have made collaborative tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom invaluable.\n\n\nThese technologies can bridge physical distance and ensure that work gets done efficiently and inclusively, even in remote settings. However, technology alone doesn’t build meaningful relationships within teams.\n\n\nLeaders must step in to create environments where their teams feel safe, heard, and valued. This concept, known as psychological safety, plays a major role in fostering innovation and collaboration.\n\n\nEmployees are far more likely to contribute bold ideas and take calculated risks in organizations where leadership prioritizes their well-being.\n\n\nIn a hybrid or remote work context, tools like AI-supported employee sentiment analysis can provide insights into workforce morale. Still, it is a leader’s continued investment in direct conversations and personal encouragement that fortifies trust.\n\n\nHarnessing Data for Strategic Insight\n\n\nAnother critical area of convergence is decision-making. Technology allows leaders to analyze everything from sales trends to customer sentiment in real-time. Leaders can make more informed choices, reallocating resources quickly to respond to market shifts.\n\n\nData, however, has its limits. Numbers on a spreadsheet can tell you what customers are buying—but not necessarily why they’re choosing one product over another. It takes a human leader to dig deeper and interpret the emotional influences on customer behavior. Technology is only as good as the human insights driving it.\n\n\nThis blend of evidence-based decision-making and strategic foresight is reshaping how leaders operate. AI might suggest which leadership hire would excel in an \nindustrial professional recruitment\n process. Still, it takes human wisdom, experience, and gut instinct to decide who will best align with organizational culture and values.\n\n\nThe Key to Future Leadership Success\n\n\nSo, how can leaders best navigate this intersection of human expertise and technology? By focusing on three core areas:\n\n\n\n\nAdopt a “Tech-Augmented” Mindset:\n Leaders must view technology as a means to elevate their own decision-making and interpersonal skills—not as a way to replace them. AI and analytics can provide valuable insights, but decisive action and meaningful team interactions are where humans thrive.\n\n\nDevelop Cultural Agility:\n It's pivotal for leaders to infuse effort into fostering open and accepting environments that spotlight trust and teamwork. Emotional acuity and understanding considerably contribute to keeping solid human ties.\n\n\nPrioritize Continuous Learning:\n The future anticipates flexibility and continuous growth from leaders alongside technological progress. Partnering with experts like leadership development management services firms or engaging with cutting-edge training programs can ensure leaders stay ahead of the curve.\n\n\n\n\nGet Extraordinary Help from The Taplow Group\n\n\nAt the intersection of technology and human expertise, extraordinary leadership is born. It’s a delicate balancing act between advancing organizations through data, automation, and AI, all while inspiring teams with heart, intuition, and shared purpose.\n\n\nTechnology will progress ceaselessly. However, the fundamentals of supreme leadership—constructing reliability, rallying teamwork, and enabling values-driven resolutions—will perpetually stay as a fundamental human pursuit.\n\n\nIn this dynamic synergy between technology and human expertise, leaders will not only shape the future of work but create lasting impacts that carry far beyond the digital age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (1654)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Leadership transitions are inevitable, and so you should be prepared for them. This can be helpful in organizational growth in the long run since a pool of competent leaders is being developed.\n\n\nLet us take a look at how succession planning is correlated with the development of leadership.\n\n\nWhether you are a board member of a \nboard governance services firm\n, an executive, or a business owner, this guide will help you understand how succession planning can enhance an organization’s future.\n\n\nWhat is Succession Planning, and Why Does It Matter for Leadership Development?\n\n\nSuccession planning is a forethought to success in business organizations. This is why it is equally essential to have account managers in place for instances when retirement, changes in careers, or other unforeseen reasons remove the current leader from the organization. This is one of the two required routes for any successful business organization.\n\n\nOnce an organization links succession planning with leadership development, it becomes a strategy. Businesses seeking new leaders on the market will be paid in gut-wrenching uncertainty; however, when leaders develop talent that the organization already has, there are no uncertainties.\n\n\nThe Importance of Succession Planning for Business Continuity and Growth\n\n\nAn established succession plan helps create plenty of benefits. There are several tangible benefits:\n\n\nBusiness Continuity  \n\n\nUnexpected leadership changes can cause a ripple effect of uncertainty. Succession planning mitigates that risk. With clear plans in place, companies maintain stability during transitions, ensuring smooth day-to-day operations.\n\n\nEmployee Retention and Engagement\n\n\nAchievable milestones do exist in the workplace. An organization’s leadership development programs communicate the message of faith toward potential employees, so the cost of losing out on potential employees is also less.\n\n\nStrategic Growth\n\n\nSuccession planning is vital for every organization’s growth and is indeed more of a business strategy than merely preparing for a crisis. This process allows for a better understanding and development of the leaders in charge, which is how industries will be able to stay competitive.\n\n\nStrong Governance  \n\n\nSuccession planning ensures transparency and accountability within leadership transitions for organizations partnered with a board governance services firm. This proactive approach enhances trust among stakeholders.\n\n\nBest Practices and Strategies for Successful Succession Planning\n\n\nHere is a list of the best approaches one should incorporate into succession planning to ensure success and shift one's focus away from failure.\n\n\n#1: Start Early and Think Long-term  \n\n\nIn fact, succession planning isn’t achieved in one go but feels more like a cycle. Focus on clear high tactics and their improvement by searching potential candidates at an early age. This builds a strong pipeline of future-ready candidates.\n\n\n#2: Create a Leadership Development Framework  \n\n\nAlign succession plans with robust leadership development programs. Address gaps in skills by offering personalized growth opportunities such as mentoring, training sessions, or leadership workshops. An executive consultant can even provide insights into emerging leadership trends that your organization can tap into.\n\n\n#3: Encourage Transparent Communication  \n\n\nMake sure that everyone is on the same page so that having these conversations later on does not waste time.\n\n\n#4: Diversify the Talent Pool  \n\n\nDon’t limit leadership opportunities to a specific group. Identify diverse candidates from different departments and perspectives. By broadening the talent pool, your organization benefits from varied expertise and insights.\n\n\n#5: Use Analytics to Inform Decisions  \n\n\nOrganizations can implement data-driven solutions to make better choices by gathering and analyzing information to recognize strengths and weaknesses. This would give them an opportunity to leverage AI and analytics in evaluating employee performance and predicting leadership potential.\n\n\n#6: Partner with Experts  \n\n\nWorking with an \nexecutive search consultant\n can bring valuable expertise and structure to your succession planning process. Their guidance ensures a smooth transition for even the most complex leadership roles.\n\n\nThe Future of Succession Planning and Emerging Trends\n\n\nThe business landscape and the approach to succession planning are evolving rapidly. Here are a few trends shaping the future:\n\n\nAI and Predictive Analytics\n\n\nAdvanced tools are now helping organizations identify high-potential leadership candidates faster and more accurately. AI-powered platforms assess leadership traits, paving the way for informed, efficient decisions.\n\n\nCross-functional Leadership  \n\n\nLeadership does not exist in isolation of one branch anymore. Organizations are more interested in leaders who can lead different functions because this is how business is positioned now.\n\n\nFocus on Emotional Intelligence  \n\n\nThe definition of leadership has evolved so that it can be defined by more soft skills such as empathy, adaptiveness, and emotional intelligence. So, looking forward, leadership programs will focus more on these aspects of leadership.\n\n\nRemote Leadership Development  \n\n\nAs remote working becomes the new norm, organizations are rolling out more virtual training modules to develop leaders who operate in a hybrid and fully remote work culture.\n\n\nStrengthen Your Organization with The Taplow Group\n\n\nSuccession planning is about strategically building a legacy. When you prioritize leadership development within your business strategic priorities, you increase your chances of success.\n\n\nWhether you own a start-up, a top executive, or a stakeholder, it is never too early to commence succession planning.\n\n\nPartner with a \nleadership development management services\n firm like The Taplow Group that aligns with your values to create a succession plan tailored to your needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2519)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "How to Assess Leadership Qualities During a CEO Search?\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nThursday, December 12, 2024\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe appointment of a CEO is always one of the most sensitive decisions that a board or shareholders of a company can make.\n\n\nA CEO determines the path of development of an organization, on the one hand, determines and creates organizational culture on the other and bears responsibility for overcoming difficulties and getting benefits from the opportunities. But how can one guarantee that they have chosen the best for the organization’s needs?\n\n\nEvaluating leadership potential during a CEO search is not easy and is a combination of good analysis, judgement, and an understanding of what the job involves. \n\n\nIn cases where a company is using professional \nCEO search services\n or in situations where the process is handled within the company, there is a need to undertake a proper analysis of a candidate’s leadership prospects.\n\n\nThis is How You Assess Leadership Qualities During CEO Search\n\n\n#1: Define Leadership in the Context of Your Organization\n\n\nIt cannot be said that leadership means the same thing in every organization, in every department, in every team or division, at every level and in every country. When you are ready to evaluate candidates, make sure you know what leadership is according to the framework of your company.\n\n\nIt also makes it easier to match a candidate’s abilities and approach to leadership with the achievements you have set for your business. For example, someone leading in the \ncommunication sector consultancy\n might require a collaborative style, while a manufacturing-based firm might value stringent operational oversight. Defining this context is the foundation of an effective assessment.\n\n\n#2: Evaluate Visionary and Strategic Thinking\n\n\nMerely, there is a need to think big and this is why a CEO should be over-ambitious to think big and also be realistic. That means you need to find a leader who can think or can think beyond the current fiscal year, the current business strategy, and the current business model.\n\n\nThink about how the candidate maps it out to existing and future trends, changes, and disruptions within the market.\n\n\nTo evaluate this, ask strategic, situational questions during an interview, such as:\n\n\n\n\n“How did you implement a long-term vision in your previous role?”\n\n\n“Can you walk us through how you’ve managed unexpected marketplace disruptions?”\n\n\nDo their responses demonstrate clarity, adaptability, and an ability to inspire others to rally behind their vision?\n\n\n\n\n#3: Communication and Influence: A Core Leadership Skill\n\n\nA great leader doesn’t work on his own, he also leads others towards the execution of certain goals. It is crucial to assess if the candidate can communicate both strategically & empathetically.\n\n\nAnother aspect to test is their influence. A CEO must foster trust, encourage collaboration, and even persuade resistant employees or board members to embrace change.\n\n\n#4: Emotional Intelligence: A True Marker of Leadership\n\n\nTechnical skills coupled with soft skills, however, lack of emotional intelligence (EI) differentiates the average CEOs and the great CEOs.\n\n\nEQ assessments can reveal how potential CEOs navigate challenges like conflicts within the senior team or moments of organizational uncertainty.\n\n\nSeek people who have awareness of self and others, people skills, tenacity and courtesy, and people who do not lose their temper easily.\n\n\n#5: Adaptability in a Fast-Changing Landscape\n\n\nThe business context today is a dynamic one, and thus, the business has to avoid what may be called a ‘business-as-usual’ approach. Every strong contender for the CEO needs to be flexible in the process of decision making as well as prepared to change when necessary.\n\n\nAdaptability has to do with a leader’s ability to be calm in the midst of a tornado, which is a very valuable skill nowadays.\n\n\n#6: Assess Cultural Alignment and Team Building Skills\n\n\nA CEO’s leadership shouldn’t exist in a vacuum. Their style and vision must harmonize with your organization’s culture while establishing a strong foundation for team collaboration at every level.\n\n\nHaving candidates participate in informal team discussions or leadership simulations with senior management is a great way to observe their ability to foster collaboration, delegate effectively, and lead with diplomacy.\n\n\n#7: Proven Experience: A Track Record of Leadership\n\n\nNo assessment of leadership is complete without examining a candidate’s previous accomplishments. Pull back the curtain and examine the true impact of their tenure in past roles.\n\n\nKey questions to consider include:\n\n\n\n\nDid they successfully manage \ninterim management services\n during periods of organizational shifts, such as mergers or financial crises?\n\n\nHow did they handle scaling operations, navigating new markets, or achieving sustainable profitability?\n\n\nHave they created a leadership pipeline and mentored talent to secure the long-term health of the organization?\n\n\n\n\n#8: Include Psychometric and Behavioral Assessments\n\n\nWhile interviews and reference checks are traditional tools, psychometric assessments can offer an unbiased window into a candidate’s personality, behavioural tendencies, and leadership potential.\n\n\nThese tests evaluate traits like problem-solving abilities, resilience, decision-making under pressure, and alignment with organizational culture. Pair these assessments alongside real-life scenarios or case interviews to test whether a candidate’s personality fits the role demands.\n\n\n#9: Never Overlook References and Due Diligence\n\n\nLastly—and perhaps most importantly—conduct thorough reference checks. Speak with former colleagues, board members, and direct reports to gather insights into the candidate’s leadership methods, relationships, and decision-making.\n\n\nFocus your conversations on understanding how the candidate inspires loyalty, handles conflicts, and creates measurable impact.\n\n\nRely on the Best CEO Search Firm - The Taplow Group\n\n\nAt \nThe Taplow Group\n, our professionals help organizations attract and retain talents that drive growth and momentum. We understand that different values and objectives drive every organization, and for that, we bring experience, objectivity, and best practices to the table.\n\n\nAssessing leadership qualities during a CEO search is as much about science as it is about intuition.

It is coupled with teaching techniques for handling any emotion that crops up.\n\n\nWhy EQ is Crucial\n\n\nEQ is essential in the workplace because it forms the basis of the networks on which organizational teams rely for their cohesion and compassion. Self-professed, emotionally intelligent managers create conditions when workers feel respected, which, in turn, motivates them to an increased level of performance, promotes teaming, and decreases conflicts.\n\n\nHow to Enhance Your EQ\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Awareness:\n The next step is to understand the emotions that give rise to certain behavior patterns, guaranteeing the efficiency of the measures taken.\n\n\nEmpathy:\n Be able to comprehend the feelings of other individuals.\n\n\nSocial Skills:\n Manage relationships to move people in desired directions.\n\n\n\n\n#3: Adaptability\n\n\nChange is the only constant in the ever-shifting business landscape. Thus, adaptability emerges as one of the essential skills for current leaders. It signifies a readiness and eagerness to alter approaches in light of fresh data or unpredicted situations.\n\n\nWhy Adaptability Matters\n\n\nLeadership adaptability is significant because it mirrors the capacity needed to operate in the contemporary environment of a dynamic business.\n\n\nTips to Cultivate Adaptability\n\n\n\n\nEmbrace Change:\n Learn to embrace change because it is almost always the key to development.\n\n\nStay Informed:\n The developments in the industry and new technologies.\n\n\nExperiment:\n Experiment and expect that many ideas will not work out well.\n\n\n\n\n#4: Strategic Thinking\n\n\nEffective team leadership requires strategic thinking. This involves anticipating future trends, identifying opportunities, and making informed decisions.\n\n\nThe Importance of Strategic Thinking\n\n\nStrategizing leaders view the business environment from a broad perspective and allow for input of factors from within and outside the organization that may affect it. They assess industry forces, opportunities, and threats and hence define strategies and the right strategies for resource deployment.\n\n\nTips to Develop Strategic Thinking\n\n\n\n\nAsk Probing Questions:\n Consider the purpose and manner of every activity to the same degree as its content.\n\n\nReflect:\n Instead, ask yourself to think about what else could be of interest to consider further.\n\n\nEngage Diverse Perspectives:\n Sharing knowledge can blow the whistle when other people can see things that one cannot.\n\n\n\n\n#5: Decision-Making\n\n\nEffective leaders are decisive. They appreciate the importance of every decision and the waves it may set off in an organization. Making decisions, on the flip side, is an amalgamation of logic, intuition, past learning, and occasionally even the audacity to predict what comes next.\n\n\nHow to Improve Decision-Making\n\n\n\n\nSystematic Evaluation:\n Make decisions and appraise the associated risks in an organized manner.\n\n\nSeek Input:\n Ensure you are not the only one making choices; involve your team members whenever you are making some decisions.\n\n\nReflect on Outcomes:\n Organizational decision-making should include checking the implications of past decisions to enhance future choices.\n\n\n\n\n#6: Conflict Resolution\n\n\nSoft skills are critical leadership skills. They include conflict-solving, where disagreements are resolved and cooperation is emphasized. Leaders need to encourage people to speak out and ensure that they listen to everyone.\n\n\nEffective Conflict Resolution\n\n\n\n\nActive Listening:\n Discern the underlying issues behind the conflict.\n\n\nNeutrality:\n Avoid taking sides and seek solutions that prioritize the team's objectives.\n\n\nMediation:\n Foster open dialogue and promote empathy to guide the team towards a consensus.\n\n\n\n\n#7: Inspiring Leadership\n\n\nLeaders' positions are to encourage and demonstrate, with the expectation of previous schemes reflected in their subordinates. A workforce is entirely capable of being intrinsically motivated to deliver results beyond expectations, where recognition and empowerment act as the stimulus.\n\n\nBuilding an Inspirational Skillset\n\n\n\n\nCommunicate Vision:\n Share a clear vision and share good objectives that members of your team will be able to relate to.\n\n\nEmpathy:\n Encourage the team to trust each other by listening to the colleagues with empathy and Mins.\n\n\nEncourage Creativity:\n Give assistance and tools whereby you may empower your members to improve themselves and question the norm.\n\n\n\n\n#8: Continuous Learning\n\n\nLeadership is dynamic, and the only way to counter this is by embracing continuous leadership learning. Welcome criticism, be a learner and stay a learner. Your personal commitment to growth sends an extremely potent signal to the rest of your organization.\n\n\nAdopting a Growth Mindset\n\n\n\n\nEmbrace Feedback:\n Use feedback as a tool for improvement.\n\n\nSeek Knowledge:\n Stay updated with the latest industry trends and technologies.\n\n\nReflect and Adapt:\n Continuously evaluate your strategies and adapt as needed.\n\n\n\n\nThe Role of an Executive Search Consultant\n\n\nAs you navigate the intricate path of modern-day leadership, assess the merit of building a relationship with a firm specializing in executive searches. These experts can offer indispensable insights and support and can help you pinpoint and cultivate the skills demanded for achieving success in your position.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, our professional \nCEO search services\n are focused on finding the right talent for your organization who can lead and inspire.

As a professional \nexecutive search management consulting\n firm, our experience within the global talent acquisition market has revealed that leadership team development is as much a science as it is an art.\n\n\nModern organizations are surrounded by issues that have never been seen before—be it technological advancement or the volatility of the global economy. The right leadership team not only counters these challenges but also looks for loopholes in the opportunities.\n\n\n9 Effective Strategies for Building a Strong Leadership Team\n\n\n#1: Cultivate a Culture of Psychological Safety\n\n\nThe need to foster high-trust organizations is the cornerstone of great leadership teams.\n\n\nA group of people within an organization can be fully expressive, express their creativity, and innovate without rival or manager pressures. Managers have to embrace inclusiveness and model it, integrate multicultural input, and foster an organizational culture of hyper-communication.\n\n\nThis way, you facilitate your leadership team to encourage stakeholders, cooperate, and create new ideas for changing the existing paradigm and fostering organizational success.\n\n\n#2: Implement Strategic Talent Development\n\n\nProfessional development is essential for an organization as it seeks to establish a pipeline for the production of leaders.\n\n\nIt is not a conventional form of training program but learning and development plans that address training needs with a focus on each employee's development plan and the firm's objectives and vision. Mentorship should be developed systematically, organizations should give leaders a chance to experience work in other departments, and the possibility of improving skills should be endless.\n\n\nAs an organization, you must connect with a leading \nboard governance services firm\n to link your leaders to professional industry experts who can guide them and give expert insights on different challenges.\n\n\n#3: Establish Clear Goals and Expectations\n\n\nTo guide your planned actions, create goals that are S.M.A.R.T. (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound).\n\n\nMake sure that every team member receives information concerning what and how they are to do and how their job fits into the overall organizational goals.\n\n\nPromoting communication and performance feedback ensures that people are goal-directed and respond in harmony with others. This approach creates a sense of shared purpose, motivates team members, and enables more effective collaboration and accountability.\n\n\n#4: Embrace Diversity and Inclusive Leadership\n\n\nDiversity is not a fluff – it is an organizational necessity for constructing powerful top leadership teams.\n\n\nHire managers and key employees with varied thinking and approaches to work, as well as the necessary skills. Diversity means different perceptions, improved abilities to solve problems, and stimulation of creativity.\n\n\nWhen you implement organized mechanisms to reduce prejudice in hiring, promotions, and work groups, you'll build a more diverse, innovative, and, ultimately, stronger leadership roster.\n\n\n#5: Prioritize Emotional Intelligence\n\n\nEmotional intelligence, or EQ, is another competency critical for leaders that cannot be combined with technical skills.\n\n\nYou should always look for individuals who can recognize their emotions, limit their emotional experience, and have good social skills. Design pro-EQ tools meant to empower leaders in aspects related to feeling self and others in the work setting.\n\n\nThis approach builds more flexible, empathetic leadership that can deal with conflicts in individual relationships and keep a group together during difficult circumstances.\n\n\n#6: Foster a Culture of Continuous Feedback\n\n\nConstructive feedback is one of the critical components of leadership that people must focus on in organizations.\n\n\nOther forms of feedback systems in leadership performance, such as 360° feedback, offer different perspectives on leadership. Develop an organizational culture for feedback, talking straight for growth, not criticism.\n\n\nSupport discussions that empower leaders to admit their skills and weaknesses and need for development. This approach promotes personal and professional growth, enhances team communication, and creates a culture of continuous learning.\n\n\n#7: Develop Strategic Succession Planning\n\n\nSuccession planning, at a preventive level, ensures organizational functionality and a steady supply of leaders.\n\n\nWhat successful leaders are present in your company, and how can you help each of them achieve their full potential? Promote future leadership population by developing an appropriate assessment of the abilities of the pupils, the performance data, and the strategic career development plans.\n\n\nThis approach mitigates risk, reduces recruitment costs, and ensures a smooth leadership transition when key roles become vacant.\n\n\n#8: Encourage Cross-Functional Collaboration\n\n\nEliminate barriers often set by organizational structures by encouraging cross-function experiences and, indeed, cooperation. \n\n\nSwap leaders around at different departments, provide teams with cross-functional tasks and come up with successful initiatives that would entail various forms of skills.\n\n\nThis approach broadens leadership perspectives, enhances organizational understanding, and creates a more integrated, agile leadership team.\n\n\n#9: Leverage Technology and Data-Driven Insights\n\n\nIntegrate a high level of analysis and technologies in leadership development.\n\n\nImplement data-driven assessment tools, use AI-powered learning platforms, and leverage predictive analytics to identify leadership potential.\n\n\nThese technologies provide deeper insights into individual and team performance, enabling more targeted development strategies.\n\n\nBuild a Strong Leadership Team with The Taplow Group\n\n\nChoosing Taplow Group means partnering with a global leader in \nleadership advisory services\n and executive search.\n\n\nOur proven methodologies and global expertise ensure that your organization doesn't just build a stronger leadership team but creates leadership legacies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2361)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

It ensures the employer catches the attention of the best employees by selling a brand, that is attractive to the best candidates.\n\n\nThis is where our \nindustrial professional recruitment\n executives- standout hires executors — can be your strategic ally.\n\n\nEssential Tips to Build a Strong Brand that Attracts Quality Candidates\n\n\nWe place a lot of emphasis on convincing employer branding within The Taplow Group. Hiring talented employees is not as simple as listing down requirements; it entails knowing the factors that would encourage these outstanding employees.\n\n\n \n\n\n#1: Define Your Employee Value Proposition (EVP)\n\n\nArticulate What Sets Your EVP Apart\n\n\nNow and then, you've probably come across the saying, \"Quality candidates seek quality companies.\" To reach the highest level of company decision-makers, you need to explain what you can give your workforce in the form of Employee Value Proposition (EVP).\n\n\nEmphasize Growth, Leadership, and Impact Opportunities\n\n\nYour EVP should point to your organization's direction of encouraging growth and leadership and making an impact. Does your company offer mentorship & assistance, apprenticeship, and internships, or promote training and development from the ground up and involve subordinates in decision-making? These are essential elements that define your EVP and may attract executives looking into a new company to train with, grow with, and get fulfillment from.\n\n\nAlign Your EVP with Your Target Executive Profile\n\n\nThere is no need to explain that your EVP should reflect the kind of executives you want to attract. If you want to attract creative, progressive, and pioneering talent, your EVP needs to be based on a culture where change, idea generation, and risk-taking are valued.\n\n\n \n\n\n#2: Leverage Digital Channels Effectively\n\n\nOptimize Your Career Website for Executives\n\n\nIn the contemporary digital world, the employer brand is anchored on the employer's online image. Optimizing your career website is obvious. This means developing a special section where individuals can read about your organization and the roles available for talented workers.\n\n\nUtilize Social Media and Content Marketing\n\n\nMoreover, you should also appreciate social media and content marketing. Provide timely information about your company, show its values, publish materials that demonstrate your company's expertise, and present glimpses of workflow. Provide your current executives and employees more incentive to promote the brand, relate their good stories, and share information on social media platforms.\n\n\nBuild Visibility and Authenticity\n\n\nSimply generating and distributing high-quality, relevant, and sincere content not only builds brand awareness but also goes a long way in convincing top managers about your organization's honesty and willingness to communicate.\n\n\n \n\n\n#3: Foster a Culture of Excellence\n\n\nAlign Your Internal Culture with Your Brand Promise\n\n\nIf you want the correct type of people to apply to your company, you should set an example and create a culture that is consistent with the promises made in the company's advertisements.\n\n\nInvest in Leadership Development\n\n\nThis commitment to excellence should not be made only with the current employees. \nLeadership consulting\n firms and executive development programs are considered relevant partners because they show management's commitment to developing a strong leadership bench.\n\n\n \n\n\n#4: Partner with a Reputable Executive Search Firm\n\n\nAlthough developing the employer brand is a sensible and important step, it remains difficult for organizations to manage executive recruitment themselves. This is where outsourcing to a quality executive search firm like The Taplow Group becomes paramount.\n\n\nBenefit from Industry Expertise and Networks\n\n\nTo fill our clients' job openings, The Taplow Group looks for robust professional networks that will attract passive employees who are currently not on the job hunt.\n\n\nRigorous Candidate Assessment\n\n\nIn addition, the comprehensive candidate evaluation system and our \nCEO training program\n guarantee that the executors presented are suitable for your company in terms of both technical and cultural compatibility.\n\n\n \n\n\n#5: Measure and Refine Your Strategy\n\n\nMonitor Key Metrics for Ongoing Improvement\n\n\nBuilding an eminent employer brand requires persistent work, not a mere single attempt. For optimum effectiveness, the significant parameters to consider are the quality of applicants, the duration to secure a hire, and the sturdiness of the retention factor for new executive members.\n\n\nGather Feedback and Adapt\n\n\nObtaining feedback from candidates and freshly recruited employees regularly is essential to comprehending their view of your employer brand and pinpointing improvements. This crucial comprehension becomes instrumental in fine-tuning your tactics to maintain the allure and relevance of your employer brand, keeping pace with the dynamic demands and anticipations of premier talent.\n\n\nPosition Your Organizations Strength with The Taplow Group\n\n\nIn today's fiercely competitive arena, a commanding employer brand has shifted from a lavish option to a prerequisite.\n\n\nBy engaging with \nThe Taplow Group\n for collaboration and consistent reforming of your strategies, you can take the necessary strides towards becoming an envisioned destination for potential talents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2175)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

The generational trends that have come up are mostly aligned toward independence, meaning, and upward mobility. Engaging them is the key to conforming to their rights and ensuring they appeal to qualified candidates.\n\n\nSocietal Trends and Values\n\n\nPeople are getting altruistically inclined towards sustainability and have started focusing on social issues of the environment and ethical practices. These values are also supported by empowering employees; the more employees are empowered, the more they feel responsible for turning organizations into ethical and socially responsible organizations.\n\n\nImplementing a CEO Training Program for Effective Leadership\n\n\nThe CEO training program is necessary for implementation in the fast-paced business environment of the modern world. It is a platform that assists you with the leadership traits necessary for working in an environment. These programs teach you to handle complexity and uncertainty, improving your ability to lead.\n\n\nUnderstanding the benefits and components of these programs is crucial. It gives you insights into their effectiveness.\n\n\nBenefits of CEO Training Programs\n\n\nCEO training programs offer many advantages. They reduce employee turnover and increase motivation. Organizations that engage in leadership training and development will experience a significant shift in workplace culture.\n\n\nEngaged employees are more creative and committed. These programs also help with succession planning, ensuring the company's success. They enhance communication skills, promoting collaboration and innovation.\n\n\nAs per various studies around the globe, organizations with CEO training experience more significant growth.\n\n\nKey Elements of Modern Leadership Development\n\n\nAssessment\n\n\nModern \nleadership development\n starts with a needs assessment. This identifies strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\nProgram Objectives\n\n\nClear program objectives help focus on improving skills like strategic thinking and emotional intelligence.\n\n\nTraining\n\n\nTraining should be tailored to the organization, ensuring relevance and usefulness.

However, building effective leadership requires careful consideration, strategy, and, often, the expertise of leadership consultants.\n\n\nHow to Build the Right Leadership for Your Organization?\n\n\nUnderstand Your Leadership Needs\n\n\nThe primary step to building leadership is evaluating your organization’s requirements, visions, and belief systems. You need to know your problems and whether you are aiming for long-term or short-term objectives. This will give you clarity on the type of leadership you are looking for.\n\n\nYou can also call for a thorough assessment of your current organizational leadership skills and competencies. This will give you an opportunity to pinpoint the areas of improvement and make your way for the future.\n\n\nEmbrace Diversity in Leadership\n\n\nDiversity is one of the crucial principles of successful management. Diversity among the leadership teams implies that there are different visions, ideas, perceptions, and solutions to a given problem. This has the potential to boost creativity and innovation within your organization while tapping into the benefits of employing a diverse workforce.\n\n\nWhen interviewing employees, make it a point to ensure that you get a team of leaders who are diversified and have different specialties. In this way, he means that it is creative to create an environment that encompasses all the perspectives that can be useful for your organization.\n\n\nEffective Talent Acquisition\n\n\nOnce you have a clear understanding of your leadership needs and the importance of diversity, the next step is talent acquisition. This is often where \nleadership consultant firms\n make a significant impact.\n\n\nThese firms deal with executive search, and the benefit of it is that they use their networks and experience to identify qualified candidates who are also a good fit for your organization. That way, you have an opportunity to outsource the whole hiring process and ensure you get the right human resources for your leadership positions.\n\n\nDevelop Leadership Skills\n\n\nRegardless of the proper recruitment of leadership, you have to enhance ongoing leadership development. The idea of leadership discussed here does not exclude the moment when a manager or an employee gets the position; it defines leadership as a process. Coaching and feedback, training, and avails play a crucial role in cultivating leaders.\n\n\nUse leadership development programs that include specific management competencies needed by organization employees, such as communication, decision-making, and conflict-solving. These forms of learning improve personal performance and, therefore, organizational effectiveness, and they also build leadership talent within your organization.\n\n\nLeverage Board Advisory Services\n\n\nIn some cases, organizations face transitional periods or strategic restructuring. This is where \nboard advisory services\n come into play. These services provide expert guidance on governance structures, leadership effectiveness, and organizational performance.\n\n\nEngaging with advisory services can offer fresh perspectives and strategic insights. It’s an opportunity to reevaluate your leadership structure and make informed decisions that align with your business objectives. These experts can work alongside your existing leadership, providing critical support during times of change.\n\n\nImplement Interim Management Solutions\n\n\nThere will be occasions when you’ll need temporary leadership solutions, particularly during transitions or unforeseen circumstances. \nInterim management\n can bridge gaps and ensure continuity within your organization.\n\n\nInterim leaders can bring new expertise and perspectives to your team. They can help stabilize operations and ensure that leadership goals are maintained until permanent placements are made. Engaging professionals experienced in interim management can provide the expertise needed to navigate tricky situations without disrupting your workplace dynamics.\n\n\nFoster a Culture of Leadership\n\n\nFinally, building exemplary leadership is more than just about appointing individuals to positions of power. Improve the leadership positional culture where everyone in the organization is encouraged to be a leader. You should let your employees do more on their own and also make them feel that they are responsible for whatever is going on in the workplace.\n\n\nEmpower your teams by providing opportunities for them to lead projects and contribute to decision-making processes. When everyone in the organization feels valued and engaged, leadership becomes a collective effort.\n\n\nWrapping Up\n\n\nExemplary leadership is not a destination; it’s a journey.

Companies are also adjusting their selection process; they are heading towards online employment portals and social networking sites to cover several applicant spectra or passive employment seekers.\n\n\nAs for them, virtual interviews and the use of AI in the preliminary selection of candidates help them reduce the time and money spent and, therefore, optimize work.\n\n\nKey Technologies Transforming Industrial Professional Recruitment\n\n\nIt is now clear that they are in the process of transformation, and thus, the functions that shape them and the required skills are also changing. Conventional recruitment techniques cannot address the needs of this sector anymore. Technological advancements have made the process more accessible, and you get the best candidates for your organization.\n\n\nHere are some key technologies that are revolutionizing industrial professional recruitment:\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\n\n\nAI and ML are the future and the present, and to your surprise, these tech solutions have already started the transformation in \nchange management\n \nand hiring:\n\n\nAutomated candidate screening:\n It can apportion a relatively short time to compare each submitted resume or application to the desired skills and experience.\n\n\nPredictive analytics:\n From previous records, AI can identify which of the candidates is most suitable for the position and could possibly do well in that job, therefore cutting down on the time and effort taken on interviews.\n\n\nChatbots:\n Using AI, a chatbot can respond to candidate questions immediately and save the company's staff time on applications.\n\n\nBig Data Analytics\n\n\nAnalytics and data mapping are crucial while and before hiring a candidate for any role:\n\n\nData-driven decision-making\n: Big data will assist you in harnessing the talent trends of candidates, behavior analysis, and additional information on the recruitment approach.\n\n\nTalent mapping:\n Understanding your industry, competitors, and job market data allows you to treat job requirements as tools to attract the best-qualified personnel.\n\n\nApplicant Tracking Systems (ATS)\n\n\nATS works as a central hub of database and automates the hiring workflow for good:\n\n\nCentralized candidate management:\n ATS platforms encompass facilities for storing and updating candidates' details in a master database.\n\n\nAutomated workflows:\n Some activities that can be done through ATS include making interviews, sending reminder notes to the candidates, and monitoring the candidates' progress.\n\n\nIntegration with other tools:\n Other features can be implemented to work with the ATS, such as background checks and drug screenings, which help the hiring process.\n\n\nThe Role of Technology in Streamlining Industrial Professional Recruitment\n\n\nTechnology has emerged as a powerful tool for streamlining industrial professional recruitment:\n\n\nTalent Acquisition Platforms\n\n\nAnd one can hardly imagine the pre-Internet recruitment practices based on such enumerated basics as job boards.

Virtual assessments, including interviews, come in handy in that they are convenient and cheap.\n\n\nWith video conferencing technology, the recruiters can interview the candidates, while the candidates themselves save a lot of trips and expenses. Besides, in virtual assessments, pupils' skills and competencies may be evaluated objectively and consistently, as in regular school conditions.\n\n\nGamified Assessments\n\n\nSkills and competencies can be easily assessed using gamified assessments because they are entertaining assessments.

    "content": "Interim Managers: Delivering Significant Impact in a Short Time\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nThursday, July 25, 2024\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 3.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you ever felt like your business needs additional expertise, people who can add valuable insights and skills, to specific projects or crisis management situation?  Without any commitment to a permanent position? Interim Managers provide such skills and expertise. \n\n\nWhenever your organization’s key leader leaves unexpectedly, your company experiences a growth spurt that demands new leadership skills, or your organization experiences restructuring. These are all situations where traditional hiring might feel too slow or cumbersome, and interim management comes into the picture.\n\n\nInterim executives are experienced leaders who arrive at your organization, assess the situation, and deliver impactful results quickly.\n\n\nWho are Interim Managers, and How do they Help Organizations?\n\n\nInterim managers are essentially leadership executives who are available for temporary assignments! They bring a wealth of experience across different industries, having tackled complex challenges and led successful projects.\n\n\nThe beauty of \ninterim managers\n is that they focus on achieving specific goals within a defined timeframe. They're not there to become part of the organization permanently—they're just there to deliver results and then move on to the next challenge.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Value Proposition of Interim Managers\n\n\nSo, how exactly do interim managers deliver that impact? Here’s the breakdown:\n\n\nExpertise and Proven Track Record\n\n\nInterim managers have extensive experience and industry knowledge. They've seen it all, from leading high-growth startups to navigating complex turnarounds.\n\n\nThey come in quickly and hit the ground running. They can quickly assess the situation, identify critical issues, and start delivering quick wins that make a real difference.\n\n\nFocus and Objectivity\n\n\nUnlike some permanent hires who might get sidetracked by internal politics, interim managers achieve your specific goals. They come in with a clear mission and a defined timeframe.\n\n\nThere's no time for office drama; their focus is laser-sharp on delivering the results you need fast. They manage your organizational project silently and swiftly and leave a trail of success.\n\n\nCost-Effectiveness\n\n\nAs an organization, you know that hiring a full-time executive can be a hefty investment. Interim managers offer a cost-effective solution. You only pay for their expertise for the duration of the project, making them a budget-friendly option for achieving a significant impact.\n\n\nAdditionally, the flexibility of engagement duration is another win. You get the expertise you need without the long-term commitment.\n\n\n \n\n\nCritical Situations are where Interim Managers excel\n\n\n#1: Leadership Gap Management\n\n\nA sudden vacancy can make your organization stand alone in the open market. These leadership gaps can eat your brand image, revenue, and long-term organizational stability.\n\n\nThis is where interim executives come in with their wealth of experience. They can:\n\n\nStep in seamlessly:\n Unlike a permanent hire, there's no long onboarding process. Interim executives hit the ground running, quickly understanding your company culture and needs.\n\n\nMaintain stability:\n They provide a steady hand and ensure day-to-day operations continue smoothly, keeping your team focused and morale high during the transition.\n\n\n#2: Turnaround Situations\n\n\nIs your company facing financial challenges or operational roadblocks? Traditional solutions can be slow and expensive. Here's where an interim manager shines!\n\n\nThey bring a fresh perspective, identify the root causes of your problems, and implement effective solutions to get your business back on track. They deliver quick wins and ensure the long-term sustainability of your organization.\n\n\n#3: Large-Scale Project Management\n\n\nDo you have a massive project that needs specific specialization, such as a merger or an acquisition?\n\n\nLook for interim executives with specific project management experience who can apply their knowledge, which is beneficial for your project. Don’t waste time and money on searching for people who aren’t efficient enough.\n\n\n \n\n\nHow to Choose the Right Interim Manager?\n\n\nHere's how you can pick the right interim manager:\n\n\nGet Clear on Your Needs\n\n\nFirst things first, outline the specific aspects that you feel are challenging for your organization. What are the intended consequences? Once you have a clear picture of your goals, you’ll look for the set skills to achieve them.\n\n\nPro Tip: Research top \nexecutive search firms\n and choose the best firm to work with. They could use their network and experience to source for a solution that best suits your needs, thus saving you a lot of time.\n\n\nLook for Experience\n\n\nSearch for an interim manager who has dealt with issues that are similar to those you are facing. There is no doubt that successful formulas of the past are sure to be successful in the future as well.\n\n\nLeadership Skill\n\n\nEffective leadership is critical!

These experts offer a powerful combination of experience and objectivity and become your trusted partner in navigating even the most challenging situations.\n\n\nWhy Do Companies Need Crisis Preparedness?\n\n\nAs an organization, you may experience mountain highs of success, exhilarating moments of innovation, and vast landscapes of opportunity.

Board advisors can assist you in developing a proper and effective communication policy/strategy. This ensures that all stakeholders, including employees, customers, and investors, receive the right information at the right time, thus reducing confusion and building trust.\n\n\nIndependent Perspective\n\n\nBoard Advisory Services play the role of bringing in a completely unbiased view of things.

They require leaders, and if your organization does not have them, they direct you to excellent \nleadership development programs\n. These programs ensure that your team is adequately trained to handle a crisis not only to contain an existing one but also to avoid future ones.\n\n\nThe Board's Role in Crisis Management\n\n\nHere's a breakdown of their key responsibilities:\n\n\nOversight and Guidance\n\n\nThe board checks that there is a crisis response plan with management and backs it up by conducting check-ups at least annually. Management is supervised and advised by them for crisis management.\n\n\nStrategic Decision-Making\n\n\nThe board of directors has major decisions to make concerning the future actions of the business in case of a crisis. These decisions can range from how resources are to be deployed to how communication is to take place and possibly changes of leadership.\n\n\nRisk Management\n\n\nThe board is responsible for risk management, which involves screening and preventing risky incidences that may result in a crisis. They also ensure that the firm has mechanisms that embrace risk management proactively.\n\n\nMaintaining Stakeholder Confidence\n\n\nThe board is formally responsible for providing information to the major stakeholders, especially during a crisis. They work to maintain trust and confidence in the company's leadership and future.\n\n\nLeadership Evaluation\n\n\nIn some cases, the board may need to evaluate the CEO's performance during a crisis. If necessary, they can make crucial decisions about leadership changes.\n\n\nChoose Taplow Group to Navigate Organizational Crisis\n\n\nMany times, organizations anticipate crises but cannot take action to navigate them.

That's a significant jump, right?\n\n\nBut how is strong leadership contributing to profitability? Is it possible to transform ordinary leadership into extraordinary leadership?\n\n\nYes, cultivating strong leadership is smooth with \nleadership development programs\n (LDPs). These targeted initiatives are the real game-changer for any organization.\n\n\nLeadership programs equip your leaders with the skills and knowledge to navigate challenges, inspire teams, and ultimately drive your organization toward success.\n\n\nLink Between Effective Leadership and Organizational Success\n\n\nImagine an organization where your team works together seamlessly, is motivated, and is evident in the company's goals. Now, imagine the person guiding them – a strong, inspiring leader who fosters a positive environment and empowers everyone to excel. That's the magic of effective leadership, and it's the key ingredient for organizational success.\n\n\nA great leader sets a clear vision and a roadmap for the organization's direction. They inspire you to want to do it. They create a work environment where you feel valued, respected, and supported. This translates directly to employee engagement.\n\n\nStrong leadership also involves strategic decision-making.

This way, the individuals mentioned are developed and ready to assume future leadership positions within the firm.\n\n\nIt promotes leadership succession, which means every organization is assured of a pool of capable talents to deal with any leadership crisis.\n\n\nFosters a Culture of Continuous Learning and Development\n\n\nDevelopment programs create a continuous learning culture in an organization. When employees feel that their organization is contributing to their growth, it serves as a strong message.\n\n\nThis builds up a positive attitude towards learning, especially when faced with difficulties, bearing in mind that they are in an academic institution to learn.\n\n\nImproves Employee Engagement and Retention\n\n\nThis is one of the absolute truths since being an investor means investing in your team. The system shows an organized company that cares for the employees' development through training programs, for example.\n\n\nThis means that employee turnover is reduced, and the level of employee participation in the organization is improved. The employees are happy and motivated to work this way, so there will be reduced turnover in the organization.\n\n\nEnhance Innovation and Adaptability\n\n\nThe business environment we work in is dynamic, and therefore, the leadership programs help leaders prepare for change.\n\n\nThey acquire skills of flexibility and tolerance of paradox, which enable them to accept change and guide their subordinates in the change process. This proves that your organization is flexible in approaching and adapting to changes; hence, it will be competitive in a volatile environment.\n\n\nCritical Components of a Successful Leadership Development Program\n\n\nTargeted Content\n\n\nNot all leaders face the same challenges. A first-time manager needs different tools than a professional executive. So, the best leadership programs personalize their content to address the specific leadership needs at various levels within your organization.\n\n\nThis ensures you're learning the most relevant skills to excel in your current role while also preparing you for future growth.\n\n\nDiverse Learning Methods\n\n\nGood development programs aim to use diverse learning methods to keep you engaged and enhance your learning retention rate. This could be in the form of engaging in team activities such as group discussions, one-on-one sessions with trainers, and even shadowing by junior employees on senior and successful employees.\n\n\nThe above and other flexible learning techniques available distinguish learning from mere acquisition of knowledge but rather make it transformative.\n\n\nActionable Takeaways\n\n\nAvid readers understand the issues better than those who only care about theory. The profound leadership sessions differ from those based on ideas and often leave you with essential tools that can be used at the workplace.\n\n\nThe program should be achievable, giving you tangible skills that will make it easy for you to be a great leader in a short period by tackling aspects like oral and written communication, critical thinking skills, and problem-solving strategies.\n\n\nFeedback and Evaluation\n\n\nContinuous improvement is essential! A strong development program incorporates mechanisms for feedback from both participants and instructors. This allows for adjustments to ensure the program is meeting its goals and equipping leaders with the most relevant skills.\n\n\nPlus, regular evaluation allows you to track your progress and measure the impact of the program on your leadership development.\n\n\nHow Taplow Group Can Help You?\n\n\nYou need a mentor or a comprehensive leadership development program to develop your leadership team and drive success to your organization.

Every organization’s success hinges on having the most efficient executives strategically placed to outmaneuver the competition. But how to find the perfect pieces to complete your puzzle of success?\n\n\nTraditional methods like job boards and internal promotions can feel like throwing darts in the dark. You might get lucky, but chances are, you'll miss the mark on attracting the kind of exceptional talent that propels businesses forward.\n\n\nThis is where \ntop executive search firms\n come into play. These firms specialize in identifying and attracting the best leadership talent you never knew existed. They help you build promising and winning teams that propel your organization to the top.\n\n\nUnderstanding the Executive Search Firm\n\n\nExecutive search firms help organizations fill critical leadership positions that can help them make strategic decisions and take the organization to the next level. Search firms act as a bridge between you and the elusive world of top talent and also offer executive interim management to organizations in need. They don’t just post job ads and hope for the best, but they actively identify, evaluate, and attract potential candidates who possess the specific skills and experience your organization needs.\n\n\nExecutive search firms are categorized into two main types: Retained and Contingent. Retained firms work exclusively with you on a pre-defined project basis, ensuring their complete focus on finding the perfect fit. Contingency firms, on the other hand, only get paid if they successfully place a candidate, which can incentivize them to fill the role quickly, not necessarily with the best fit.\n\n\nSo, the question remains: What sets these executive firms apart from traditional recruiting firms? Let’s explore the answer.\n\n\nKey Qualities of Top Executive Search Firms\n\n\nDeep Industry Knowledge\n\n\nTop executive firms are familiar with your industry, and their experts understand all its nuances. They know the specific challenges, trends, and talent pool that make your company unique. This deep understanding ensures they identify candidates who are not just highly qualified but also understand the specific landscape in which you operate.\n\n\nProven Track Record\n\n\nWhen it comes to leadership hires, experience matters; top search firms have a demonstrably successful track record of placing high-caliber executives in similar roles within your industry. As an organization, you must ask for case studies of your executive search firm to see concrete examples of how they've helped companies like yours find the perfect leader.\n\n\nPro Tip: Check to see if your executive search firm offers a \nCEO training program\n to build trust and confidence in candidates and enhance their capabilities.\n\n\nExtensive Network\n\n\nSearch firms have access to a pool of candidates that goes way beyond job boards. This includes passive candidates – passive executives who may not be looking but would be perfect for your company. With their network, top search firms attract the best and brightest, even those not looking to change.\n\n\nComprehensive Search Process\n\n\nTop search firms employ a well-defined search methodology, ensuring a thorough and meticulous process. This includes in-depth candidate assessments that go beyond resumes. They delve into skills, experience, leadership style, and cultural fit. They ensure thorough reference checks and cultural fit analysis to find a candidate who aligns with your company's values and fosters a thriving work environment.\n\n\nNegotiation & Onboarding Savvy\n\n\nThe journey doesn't end with finding the perfect candidate. Search firms excel at negotiating competitive compensation packages that attract top talent while remaining mindful of your budget. Additionally, they skillfully navigate the onboarding process, ensuring a smooth transition for the newly recruited executive. This minimizes disruption and allows the leader to hit the ground running from day one.\n\n\nLong-Term Partnership Approach\n\n\nTop search firms understand that finding the right leader is just the beginning.

Now, you need someone with a visionary mind, a proven track record, and the leadership qualities to navigate a competitive landscape. But where do you even begin?\n\n\nTraditionally, executive search for C-suite roles could take a lot of work. But the time has changed. Technology is rapidly transforming the world of \nexecutive search consulting\n, offering a number of tools to help you find the perfect fit for your most critical leadership positions.\n\n\nEvolving Landscape of Executive Search Management Consulting\n\n\nExecutive firms used to search through mountains of CVs and data, which was a time-consuming process and was limited to physical paper applications.\n\n\nHowever, times have changed, and now technology has become the compass that guides executive search firms towards a more efficient and effective future. Now, intelligent algorithms analyze vast databases and identify potential leaders. AI tools and technologies are so advanced that they assess not just qualifications but also cultural fit.\n\n\nTechnological Advancements in Executive Search\n\n\nBig Data & AI in Executive Search\n\n\nAI scans mountains of data – resumes, online profiles, even industry publications – to identify candidates with the exact skills and experience you need.\n\n\nAdditionally, it can find \"passive candidates\" who aren't actively searching but might be the perfect fit. AI can analyze all this data to predict how well a candidate might perform in your specific role.\n\n\nDigital Platforms & Social Media\n\n\nTechnology enables the creation of an engaged talent community, which is always a source of qualified candidates willing to join your company. Portals such as links are provided for professionals, and these allow for searching for millions of profiles with high-level specificity.\n\n\nThis way, you can grab the attention of more great candidates who might still need to apply to your company.\n\n\nAI & Machine Learning\n\n\nMachine learning is one of the niches of AI that entails the development of models that improve over time. The more it functions, the more optimized it becomes at identifying individuals' needs. This means one can develop extremely narrow searches for candidates.\n\n\nAI and machine learning enable executive search firms to discover those emerging leaders and only the right mix of qualities and skills for selection and \nleadership development\n training to make the right match.\n\n\nPersonalized Candidate Experiences\n\n\nTechnology isn't just about finding the right candidate; it's also about creating a positive experience for them.\n\n\nThrough automation and personalization tools, you can nurture relationships with potential hires and keep them engaged throughout the entire search process.\n\n\nRole of Technology in Executive Search\n\n\nEnhanced Candidate Sourcing\n\n\nSince Big Data and MI algorithms can search through databases on the Internet as resumes, social networking profiles, and those linked to trades, their effectiveness is exceedingly high. This can help focus the search for a candidate that not only meets all the requirements in terms of qualifications but also who has the experience and ability to do the job.\n\n\nIdentifying Passive Candidates\n\n\nAI can identify \"passive candidates,\" those who are not even looking for new job opportunities but can be perfectly fitted. This increases the quantity of talent considerably, thus allowing for access to a wider pool of potentially excellent leaders.\n\n\nPredictive Analytics\n\n\nHiring managers can use machine learning algorithms to depict candidate data and highlight the candidate's potential performance in the determined position. The above information assists in identifying the right talents for organizations/ firms with a higher probability of success in the long run.\n\n\nBuilding Talent Communities\n\n\nDigital platforms allow for the creation of targeted talent communities where pre-vetted candidates can learn about your company's culture and opportunities. This fosters long-term relationships and creates a pool of engaged individuals ready to consider new roles.\n\n\nAdvanced Search Functionalities\n\n\nProfessional networking sites like LinkedIn offer powerful search tools that allow for filtering candidates based on specific skills, experience, and even company background. This streamlines the search process and helps identify the most relevant talent.\n\n\nEmployer Branding & Engagement\n\n\nSocial media platforms provide a powerful tool for showcasing your company culture and employer brand. Engaging content can attract top talent who might not have otherwise considered your organization, leading to a wider pool of potential candidates.\n\n\nStreamlined Communication\n\n\nCollaboration tools and automation platforms facilitate seamless communication between Executive Search and Management Consulting teams. This ensures everyone is on the same page throughout the search process and allows for a more efficient flow of information.\n\n\nHow Taplow Leverages Technology in Executive Search?\n\n\nAt Taplow Group, our consultants utilize AI and other technology advancements to analyze, identify, and predict high-caliber candidates for a leadership role and \nadvisory board\n. Our global network allows for seamless collaboration and leverages social media to build employer brands and attract top talent.\n\n\nBy combining cutting-edge tech with human expertise; our executive search experts find the perfect leaders for your organization in an efficient and personalized way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3075)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

In the current world, organizations have been pushed to the corner to try and secure the best talents because of competition; this has seen more incorporation of AI and ML to revolutionize the possibilities of recruitment.\n\n\nIn this article, our focus is on the fact that through the application of AI and ML, search firms are gradually being transformed into real talent acquisition centers.\n\n\nIntroduction to AI and ML in Executive Search\n\n\nThe Rise of AI and ML in Talent Acquisition\n\n\nThe capability picture is shifting at a pace that seems to be unexampled. Participants are located and accessible in a broad electronic realm, and those for the position of top managers are numerous. Well, that is where we have AI and ML coming into play.\n\n\nAI and ML are changing talent acquisition significantly as they scan through data sources, seeking good talents for an organization and anticipating who meets the needs of a client.\n\n\nBenefits of Implementing AI and ML in Executive Search\n\n\nLaser-Focused Candidate Sourcing\n\n\nAI and ML can look into huge data sets and pick out the needle in the haystack for you; you would not have to spend hours ever again.\n\n\nStreamlined Candidate Evaluation\n\n\nResume and cover letter processing can also be done through AI to highlight candidates that meet your requirements and needs. It will enable you to shift your attention and concentrate on the in-depth interview while struggling to establish a healthy rapport with the most qualified candidates.\n\n\nData-Driven Decision Making\n\n\nAI, and especially ML, can help better understand the candidates’ behavior and past performance, which is very useful throughout the hiring process.\n\n\nEnhance Talent Identification and Acquisition with AI\n\n\nUtilize AI for Candidate Sourcing and Screening\n\n\nExecutives can be quickly picked from large databases due to the speed with which they parse data that is accorded to AI algorithms. In other words, AI intelligently prescreens candidates, thus giving human resource personnel more time to nurture relationships and interact with the talent.\n\n\nPersonalize Candidate Experiences through AI\n\n\nOrganizations can use AI to build personalized experiences that speak to candidates since search firms are in the business of presenting candidates to organizations. When firms make use of AI to analyze candidates’ preferences and behaviors, they will have ways of interacting with the candidates more closely and, therefore, improve the relationships drawn throughout the recruitment process.\n\n\nLeverage Machine Learning for Streamlined Recruitment Processes\n\n\nAutomate Administrative Tasks with ML Algorithms\n\n\nBased on the capabilities and capacities of machine learning technologies, the mundane clerical work of arranging interviews and composing follow-up emails, which consumes a substantial amount of time for human resource specialists, can be effectively addressed.\n\n\nThus, utilizing the features of ML can contribute to the increased operational effectiveness of search firms and the correspondingly positive candidate experience.\n\n\nImprove Candidate Matching and Selection with ML Models\n\n\nSearch firms are among the beneficiaries of ML models since the models can help review large databases of candidates and select the most likely performers of certain tasks.\n\n\nThus, with the help of ML applications, lenders can help candidates find more suitable jobs, and the latter will stay content with the organizations in which they work.\n\n\nAlso, AI and ML enhance the efficiency of \nCEO search services\n. Executive search firms apply AI and ML in search of and selection of qualified CEOs with the proper leadership temperament that will be appropriate for an organization’s organizational culture.\n\n\nThe Impact of AI and ML on Talent Acquisition Success\n\n\nMeasuring ROI and Performance Metrics in AI-Enhanced Recruitment\n\n\nAI & ML helps search firms manage metrics related to hiring, such as time-to-hire, cost per hire, and quality of candidates, which in turn enhances the recruitment results.\n\n\nEnhancing Diversity and Inclusion Efforts through AI Tools\n\n\nThis is because by using AI to reduce bias in job descriptions, find pools of diverse candidates, and eliminate bias during the selection process, search firms can create a fair recruitment environment and strong, diverse teams that lead to innovation and results.\n\n\nOvercome Challenges and Maximize Opportunities in AI-Driven Recruitment\n\n\nAddress Bias and Ethical Concerns in AI Recruitment\n\n\nAmong the more insidious issues, bias and ethics are among the often-discussed ones that affect AI-based talent acquisition. These issues have to be managed by the \nexecutive search firms\n, which should routinely check the AI algorithms they use.\n\n\nUpskill HR Professionals to Leverage AI Technologies\n\n\nTo achieve optimization of AI in talent acquisition, HR professionals require training to embrace technological advancements. It can be seen that through training programs and access to resources with information on AI or ML tools – such as Python libraries – search firms can ensure that teams apply these technologies properly.\n\n\nWrapping Up\n\n\nAI and ML have taken the talent acquisition landscape by storm, and we at Taplow Group embrace the power of these technologies. Our seasoned consultants and experts are constantly evolving with the pace of technology to offer the most sought-after search and \ninterim management\n services to organizations globally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2669)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "Role of Soft Skills in Industrial Professional Recruitment\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nThursday, June 20, 2024\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 2.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's a misconception that only technical skills and experience are crucial in industrial recruitment. The landscape of \nindustry professional recruitment\n has changed, and now, every industry needs candidates with strong, soft skills.\n\n\nRecent studies show that around 70% of organizations and executive search consultants look for soft skills while they hire. Soft skills are personal attributes that define how an individual interacts, behaves, or navigates inside the workplace. This article is all about the crucial role of soft skills in industrial recruitment for today's workforce.\n\n\n \n\n\nWhy Soft Skills Matter in Industrial Professional Recruitment?\n\n\nThe Evolving Industrial Landscape\n\n\nThe industrial world is no longer a place of regular routines. Automation, new technologies, and ever-evolving processes are the norm. So, while technical skills are crucial, soft skills like adaptability and critical thinking are the tools an organization needs to use those skills effectively.\n\n\nSoft skills are what help an individual navigate the dynamic environment and keep pace with the ever-changing industrial landscape.\n\n\nBeyond Technical Expertise\n\n\nIndustrial jobs are more than just following instructions. Teamwork is essential for smooth operation; clear communication ensures everyone's on the same page, and strong problem-solving skills keep things running efficiently.\n\n\nEffective communication ensures everyone understands their role, and strong interpersonal skills foster a supportive environment where ideas are shared, and solutions are found quickly.  These soft skills directly contribute to improved safety, reduced errors, and a more productive work environment.\n\n\nBuilding a Positive Work Culture\n\n\nIndustrial workplaces thrive on a positive and collaborative atmosphere. Soft skills like emotional intelligence and strong interpersonal skills play a key role in fostering this environment. Being able to understand and manage your emotions, as well as build rapport with colleagues, creates a sense of trust and respect.\n\n\nAn executive firm always ensures leadership qualities and soft skills during \nboard recruitment\n for any organization. This means that teamwork, communication, and strong collaboration qualities must come from the top.\n\n\n \n\n\n4 Key Soft Skills for Industrial Professionals\n\n\nCommunication Skills\n\n\nIn an industrial setting, clear and concise communication is paramount. Strong, active listening skills are also key. You need to be able to absorb information, understand concerns, and respond thoughtfully.\n\n\nWhether it's drafting reports, writing emails, or documenting procedures, strong writing skills ensure clear and accurate communication across all channels.\n\n\nTeamwork and Collaboration\n\n\nTeamwork and collaboration are valuable elements in completing projects and working effectively for the organization's success. Cooperation with colleagues from different backgrounds is the key attribute of a good team player.\n\n\nA properly coordinated team will be capable of resolving issues faster and acquainting everyone with best practices, hence attaining more optimal results.\n\n\nProblem-solving and Critical Thinking\n\n\nOne shocker always characterizes the industrial world after another, along with technical complications. Well, that is where your problem-solving skills come in! Problem-solving ability is a sign of a good candidate as it enables one to ascertain the problem, its source, and the appropriate solution.\n\n\nHaving an understanding of all aspects, evaluating information, and comparing various variants, you conclude rational decisions and achieve controlled functioning.\n\n\nAdaptability and Resilience\n\n\nChanging technologies, different processes, and other challenges have become normal for modern business. That is why flexibility is a strength in this context, as it provides the necessary opportunity to react successfully to new shifts.\n\n\nIt also implies that behavioral flexibility, especially as a coping mechanism down the line, will be necessary in tackling challenges and persevering through the setbacks that are inevitable in the long haul.\n\n\n \n\n\nStrategies for Assessing Soft Skills During Recruitment\n\n\nTraditional Methods with a Soft Skills Twist\n\n\nEverybody is familiar with the questions that cover previous work experience and desired competencies. Thus, although labels and descriptors give clues to the presence of soft skills, the only way to get real-life information from a candidate is through behavioral interview questions. This enables one to establish how the candidate employs their soft skills in practice.\n\n\nUtilize Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs)\n\n\nSituational Judgment Tests (SJTs) go beyond factual content knowledge and evaluate a candidate's capacity to approach and solve problems, make decisions, and function in a realistic workplace setting. SJTs are a great way of assessing soft skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication in relation to the industrial environment.\n\n\nGroup Exercises and Role-Playing\n\n\nGroup exercises and role-playing scenarios create a platform for candidates to demonstrate their soft skills in a collaborative setting. This allows you to observe how they communicate, collaborate, and solve problems together.\n\n\nThis allows you to assess their teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills firsthand.  Remember, it's not just about the solutions they find but also how they interact and navigate the situation as a team.\n\n\n \n\n\nGet Industrial Professional Recruitment Right with Taplow\n\n\nFinding the perfect candidate for your industrial needs goes beyond technical skills. At Taplow Group, we understand the importance of soft skills in Industrial recruitment, and that's why our consultants and experts dive deep during the onboarding process and thoroughly assess not only technical capabilities but also the crucial soft skills that contribute to a successful and cohesive team.\n\n\nWhether you're searching for a \npermanent hire\n \nor require a temporary solution with an \ninterim manager\n, our comprehensive recruitment process ensures the overall professionalism of the candidate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3259)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "Impacts of Diversity and Inclusion on Leadership Development\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nMonday, June 17, 2024\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThere’s an essential element that makes the workplace healthier and more productive, and that is diversity and Inclusion. According to multiple reports worldwide, organizations with diverse and inclusive leadership teams are 33% more efficient and outperform competitors.\n\n\nDiversity isn't always categorized by race or gender; it goes beyond that, encompassing experiences, backgrounds, and thought processes. In this guide, we will explore how diversity and inclusion impact \nleadership development\n and why an organization must choose a diverse leadership.\n\n\nWhat Defines Diversity and Inclusion in an Organization?\n\n\nDiversity and Inclusion are not just about completing checklists. It is the process of building a leadership team that has diverse points of view.\n\n\nDiversity means the degree of variation in leaders’ work experience, race, gender, and culture, and other characteristics. , coordination, and independence for their part. Inclusion can, therefore, be described as the provision of equal opportunities that seek to make everyone feel wanted and capable of contributing to the common goals in a way that best suits their abilities.\n\n\n \n\n\nBenefits of Diversity and Inclusion for Leadership Development\n\n\nEnhanced Problem-Solving and Decision-Making\n\n\nDiversity means that there is a pool of knowledge, best practices, and solutions available from people of different backgrounds. It lets organizations consider solutions that might have crossed their radar had they not exhausted all the known approaches.\n\n\nWhen every member of the team is free to express their opinions and ideas differently or even contrary to the opinion of the majority, psychological safety is created.\n\n\nFostering Creativity and Innovation\n\n\nDiversity in an organization is important for innovation. Diversity of people means that there is the existence of multiple experiences, ideas, and skills in an organization. This leads to the creation of a rather vibrant context that encourages innovation and thinking outside the box.\n\n\nLuckily, diversity is the gas of creativity, and Inclusion is the match that kindles it. This is the case where everyone is valued in the organization and is encouraged to bring their ideas into the innovation process.\n\n\nBuilding Stronger Relationships and Trust\n\n\nNow, the essence of management, especially in this modern world, is all about making relationships and earning trust with existing and potential employees and other related partners. If you cultivate a culture that can embrace everyone and give them a feeling of psychological safety, then the relationships that are created will be much stronger.\n\n\nMulticultural leaders are better placed to comprehend the various groups of people, hence enabling them to relate well with them. It makes them capable of creating trust because they learn to be empathetic when it comes to the feelings and opinions of others.\n\n\nImproved Talent Acquisition and Retention\n\n\nTalent attraction and management have always been important in any organization, more so today in the context of stiff competition for jobs. This is important for your organization, and that is why diversity and Inclusion become significant for your organization. To employ and retain effective leadership in your organization, you can work with an \nexecutive search firm\n to recruit superior executives from around the globe.\n\n\nIndividuals in organizations wish to receive recognition and be appreciated in the workplace without prejudice concerning their attributes. This implies that when everyone feels they are involved and their inputs are valued, they are likely to be committed to the success of the company; hence, they are likely to stay.\n\n\n \n\n\nStrategies to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in Leadership Development\n\n\nIdentify and Remove Biases\n\n\nEveryone has prejudices, clearly or marginally. That is why unconscious bias training is important to leaders. Envision the picture of identifying those unreasonable tendencies and coming up with ways to address them at the same time when the leader has to be chosen.\n\n\nSome of the actions taken in this regard could be similar questions asked in the interviews, diversity in the interviewing panels, and avoiding subjectivity in rating the candidates, such as favoring skills and experience.\n\n\nMentorship and Sponsorship Programs\n\n\nThis is where the aspirations of having mentorship and sponsorship programs come in handy. It is possible to find people who will provide proposals and help orient in a particular situation, or on the contrary, people who will promote your candidacy for a certain position.\n\n\nThe essence here lies in identifying compatibility in terms of training and general vision for the person who is going to support the given individual’s growth.\n\n\nCreate Inclusive Learning and Development Opportunities\n\n\nLeadership development\n programs should not be generic and similar for all employees at all levels. Essential to these programs are issues related to differentiation that meet the needs of learners.\n\n\nThe creation of a workspace where people feel safe to talk and share their ideas/noise is equally imperative. This means creating conditions in which all the people in a given team would be willing and ready to discuss their opinions and ideas with others.\n\n\nTrack Progress and Hold Leaders Accountable\n\n\nThe other powerful statement that can be derived from the data is that progress without measurement is merely a story. Specific goals for D&I in leadership should be defined, especially in terms of quantity and outcome.\n\n\nBy holding leaders accountable for these goals, you ensure that diversity and Inclusion aren't just buzzwords but become embedded in the very fabric of your leadership development strategy.\n\n\n \n\n\nDevelop your Organization Diverse and Inclusive Strategies with Taplow\n\n\nAt Taplow Group, a leading executive search firm, we understand the importance and impact of diversity and Inclusion on leadership.

But, let us clear these clouds: a team can only function efficiently with a leader or leadership capabilities.\n\n\nThis is where organizations across the world need \nleadership advisory services\n to strengthen their team's capabilities and foster a positive environment. In today's fast-paced business landscape, high-performing teams are the secret sauce that separates the extraordinary from the ordinary.\n\n\nChallenges Faced by Teams in Organizations\n\n\nIn the dynamic landscape of modern business, teams often find themselves stuck around challenges; here are some of the common challenges that hinder their progress & productivity:\n\n\nLack of clear direction and goals\n\n\nInadequate direction and directionless goals are the forces that paralyze a team and its workforce, resulting in the creation of members who need help understanding why they hold a certain position or are working in a particular team. Planning is similar to having an architectural plan for a building; when there is no plan, work turns messy, and there is no forward movement.\n\n\nIneffective communication and collaboration\n\n\nLack of good communication and poor cooperation results in teams developing some traffic islands and fosters a constricted exchange of ideas and creativity that is important for the team to prosper as a whole. Lack of understanding and misunderstanding can easily bring about frustration, which affects the level of trust.\n\n\nLow employee motivation and engagement\n\n\nLack of engagement results in a workplace atmosphere that is toxic due to poor performance, which is driven by poor motivation among employees. It can, in fact, dramatically impact a person's work and the work of the organization, stunting both productivity and creativity.\n\n\nPoor conflict resolution and interpersonal skills\n\n\nLack of conflict-solving abilities and interpersonal communication can significantly turn teams with highly skilled members into competitive arenas where team goals are forgotten for individual tendencies. The conflict that is not solved becomes a constant source of resentment within the teams, which weakens the ties within these teams.\n\n\nDifficulty adapting to change\n\n\nThe inability to manage change affects the adaptability of teams in a way that allows them to cope with the dynamic business environment. Starting to have a more rigid perspective and needing to be able to adapt to new opportunities and threats can make the team efficient and useful.\n\n\nThese challenges must be understood and fought in order to bring out the best in teams.

Boards are considered to be very important structures that set organizational goals, supervise organizational activities, and contribute their knowledge and experience.\n\n\nThus, membership attracts and retention of proficient directors remains critical as a way of ensuring that corporations select the best players to act as directors.\n\n\nWhy is Board Recruitment and Retention Important?\n\n\nBoard recruitment\n and retention remain critical because current board members play a significant role in shaping a company's future since the boards' lists comprehensively determine an organization's strategies and direction.\n\n\nIt is often stated that having a board diverse in its streams, degrees, genders, races, ages, and experiences is crucial for improving board decision-making, organizational innovation, and overall understanding of the competitive environment.\n\n\nStrategies for Successful Board Recruitment\n\n\nBy implementing these effective recruitment strategies, you can transform your board from good to great.\n\n\n#1. Develop a Clear Board Profile\n\n\nIt's, therefore, beneficial to define what 'ideal' means before joining the search. What are the essential skills you need on your board, and how do you acquire these skills and experiences?\n\n\nAre you trying to find sources of financing, a marketing team, or an experienced manager?\n\n\nIt is essential to analyze the gaps in the current board and the organizational direction that is to be taken. By being aware of the required skill sets, it is possible to design the board profile that will trigger the interest of the best employees.\n\n\n#2. Utilize Diverse Recruitment Channels\n\n\nYou don't know it yet, but you have a lot of power from the network you established when you were in high school! Inform professional associations, alum groups, other organizations, and your current colleagues or alums that you are seeking a board of directors member.\n\n\nIt is also suggested that companies focused on finding highly qualified candidates for the board cooperate with each other or use Internet resources containing the necessary information.\n\n\n#3. Prioritize a Transparent and Inclusive Process\n\n\nRecruitment begins the process of trust building, and its foundation is established by making the \norganization's board recruitment process more transparent and\n inclusive. It is necessary to clarify your requirements and deadlines regarding the selection of an appropriate candidate.\n\n\nThis way, potential candidates can decide whether or not they can afford to make the commitment. Also, avoid discrimination in the selection process while trying to recruit the most suitable candidate for the job, who could be either a student, faculty member, or staff member.\n\n\n#4. Focus on Cultural Fit\n\n\nOf course, skills and experience are one thing, but they are not everything. Recircut for individuals who have similar values as the organization and its mission. Hire an \nexecutive search firm\n that does not just stop at the resumes but asks and goes further into understanding the applicants.\n\n\nIndeed, use probing questions that will uncover the level of a candidate's commitment to your causes, whether they are passionate about them or are committed to collaborating. Think of them seated around the board table; would they be constructive and actively participate in the board?\n\n\nStrategies for Board Retention\n\n\nHere's how to cultivate a board environment where members feel valued and committed:\n\n\n#1. Onboarding and Orientation\n\n\nNew board members should be helped in the beginning by not being thrown into the deep end. Ideally, an integrated onboarding program should be created that will enable the new employees to possess all the knowledge and tools required for successful work.\n\n\nThis could include disseminating information on your organization's social purpose, annual or financial reports, business and operational or strategic plans, and other governance issues.\n\n\n#2. Ongoing Communication and Engagement\n\n\nIt is important that boards are updated regularly because this leads to a feeling of being connected, whereby all the board members are in touch. It may sound rhetorical, but the use of annual meetings shouldn't be overdone!\n\n\nSustaining relational communication can also be done through e-mail newsletters, regular or weekly business meetings via tele-/video conference, and participation in committees. This makes it possible to have continuous conversation, it lets everyone be aware of the contents and progress, and the board will always be comfortable knowing they are updated.\n\n\n#3. Professional Development Opportunities\n\n\nBoard members are usually occupied people, it does not mean, however, that they do not need to improve. Provide them with avenues that will let them build up their skills and knowledge base. Occasionally, see a need to offer them sponsorship for either some industry events such as conferences or workshops or even online classes that are related to the board's responsibilities.\n\n\nSupporting the professional development of the board members shows that the company cares about its staff members' intellectual growth and enhances the board's general performance.\n\n\n#4. Compensation and Recognition\n\n\nA board member's position is more than just a single job, given the time that one has to dedicate to it. In conveying their worth to the company, apply proper rewards and incentives that are given to them.\n\n\nIt may include honorariums, stock options, and other forms of remuneration that pay tribute to time and input to the business. Rewarding can also be done publicly during board meetings or any company event, and this will help make the worker feel valued.\n\n\n#5. Regular Performance Reviews\n\n\nAn organization must conduct board evaluations regularly to gauge effectiveness, identify areas for improvement, and address any concerns promptly. This open and honest feedback loop ensures your board remains on track to achieve your organizational goals.\n\n\nHow Can Taplow Group Help in Board Recruitment & Retention?\n\n\nAs one of the top search and \ninterim management\n firms, Taplow Group's expert professionals leverage their vast network and industry knowledge to identify exceptional candidates who perfectly align with your organization's needs.\n\n\nFrom crafting compelling board profiles to fostering a seamless onboarding experience, Taplow Group can help you assemble and retain a dream team of board members who will propel your organization toward success.\n\n\nWrapping Up\n\n\nBoard recruitment and retention are crucial elements of building a successful and effective board.

This is the primary reason why organizations need an executive search consultant for their business.\n\n\nThe consultant helps organizations hire for key roles to drive innovation and boost overall team morale. But before you (as an organization) step forward to connect with a search consultant, you must consider the following things.\n\n\n5 Key Things to Consider Before Hiring An Executive Search Consultant\n\n\nYour organization is in a hurry to fill a vital role and desperately needs a search consultant, but don't hire them before checking this list:\n\n\nConsultant's Expertise and Industry Knowledge\n\n\nBefore you hire a consultant, you must thoroughly check if they have the expertise and knowledge you need or what your industry demands. You should also check if they understand your specific sector and are updated with emerging trends, challenges, and talent dynamics.\n\n\nTheir depth of knowledge enables organizations to pinpoint the unique skills and experience required for a particular role. Their industry insights also allow them to navigate the nuances of your field, identifying individuals who not only possess the right qualifications but also align with your organization's culture and vision.\n\n\nAccess to Wider Network\n\n\nIt is crucial to understand if the \nexecutive search consultant\n has access to a broader network across industries or not. It would help if you looked for a consultant who has an active list of passive executives who are not looking for new opportunities (this is crucial).\n\n\nThe expansive network of search consultants will allow you to identify and approach the best-fit individuals for your organization. You can leverage their connections to gain access to a broader range of qualified candidates and ensure you don't miss out on the hidden candidates who could be the perfect match for your organization's leadership roles.\n\n\nSearch Methodology and Process\n\n\nA good search consultant must have structures and procedures for performing the search that are easily comprehensible. Ask them about the best recruitment and selection practices and the specific methods they use to hire the right kind of employees. A systematic approach can achieve accurate and culturally sensitive assessments.\n\n\nAdditionally, search consultants offer \nleadership development\n to organizations in need. So, it will help you if you have a clear understanding of their leadership programs and search methodologies. Their commitment to a rigorous and ethical approach can significantly impact the quality of candidates presented.\n\n\nFees and Payment Structure\n\n\nRecruiting or hiring the services of an executive search firm is not cheap. However, it is essential to know how much you will be charged as you engage the firm. Experienced consultancy companies always declare the cost structure transparently. Assess the utilization price they will command against the investment and also check other things such as their past performance, experience in the industry, and the demands of the job.\n\n\nAlso, they should find out if there are other costs, like relocation charges for the candidates or fees for some background checks, which are usually extra charges. Consumers should appreciate the fact that they can discuss the fees and payment structures to make informed decisions about the amount of money they need to part with.\n\n\nCultural Fit and Communication Style\n\n\nExecutive search consultants \nare not only hired for their skills but for the advisor that they are to the company; they become a part of the organization's culture and therefore, their means of communication should be similar to the company's. This is important during the selection process since you can evaluate their professionalism, attentiveness, and aptness to identify your business's core values.\n\n\nThe consultant who shares your company's values and translates them into business language will significantly facilitate decision-making; the candidate with whom all the fuss is over will come to work together efficiently. Their cultural sensitivity and emotional quotient will also be relevant to assessing a candidate more apt to succeed in your company's environment and thus add value in the long run in terms of retention.\n\n\nGet in Touch with Us for a Seamless Search Process\n\n\nAt Taplow Group, we take pride in our 150+ senior executive search consultants across America, Asia Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East.

Remember, it is crucial to ascertain that the search consultant works to your company's benefit because selecting the right service provider is a long-term endeavor. Thus, taking appropriate time to contemplate over and choose the right partner would help in attracting the deserving candidate to the organization that would work towards achieving success.\n\n\nThis well-informed decision will not only save you time and resources but also ensure you have the right person guiding your search now; if you don't want to save time, then you know whom to call.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2174)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

This is why and when you need to hire a search firm first.\n\n\nThere's no denying that executive search firms have become crucial for global organizations that want to hire top-level executives, C-suite executives, or boards of directors in today's business world. They have the expertise, network, and savviness to find you the best in the business.\n\n\nNow, the critical question is, how can an organization pick the right search firm for its business? The answer is hidden in the 7 factors below.\n\n\n7 Factors to Consider Before Choosing the Right Executive Search Firm\n\n\nThere are a lot of search firms in the market, but how can you be so sure that you have picked the right one for your organization? Here's the guide:\n\n\nIndustry Expertise and Specialization\n\n\nThis is the primary factor you must consider before hiring an executive search firm. You must check if they understand your niche and specialize in your industry. These search firms know your organization inside out, from the challenges you face to leadership gaps and strategies.\n\n\nIf your search firm has industry knowledge and can offer you invaluable insights on multiple steps, then you must stick with that firm and grow together.\n\n\nPro Tip: Major search firms offer \nCEO training programs\n to build relationships with top talents and create a pipeline of future leaders. You must hire these search firms.\n\n\nTrack Record and Reputation\n\n\nReputation is everything in corporate and even in the everyday world. You must take some time to research the executive search firm, its track records, past works, and client testimonials (if possible). This will help your organization pick the best firm that can better align with your organizational objectives.\n\n\nAn ideal search firm consistently delivers exceptional results and builds long-term relationships with its clients while maintaining its integrity and professionalism.\n\n\nCandidate Quality and Vetting Process\n\n\nExecutive search firms\n are different from traditional hiring firms, so they undoubtedly have the best candidates in the world. You must look for the candidate quality of the candidates, as it can make or break your organization's growth trajectory.\n\n\nAdditionally, it would help if you inquired about the firm's candidate sourcing strategies, screening processes, and assessment methodologies. Beyond resume evaluation, an ideal search firm follows a stringent vetting process and ensures that they get you the most qualified and thoroughly examined executives.\n\n\nCommitment to Diversity and Inclusion\n\n\nThe world has now understood the importance of diversity and inclusion. In today's business world, every organization has a vision to build a diverse team that fosters an inclusive workplace.\n\n\nYou must look for signs that your search firm shares your organizational vision and commitment to diversity and inclusion, actively seeks diverse candidate pools, and promotes equitable hiring practices.\n\n\nPersonalized Approach and Communication\n\n\nThe world is diverse, and so are global organizations. Each organization is unique and shares its own culture, values, and hiring needs. You must find a search firm that understands your organization's requirements and develops strategies tailored to it.\n\n\nThe most important thing is communication. When you hire a search firm, you must ensure that you communicate with them transparently and collaborate with them seamlessly.\n\n\nGlobal Reach and Network\n\n\nAn ideal search has the most extensive reach across the globe and a global network of executive talents. You might want your leadership to come from diverse backgrounds and different demographics so that your organization can get the best and most unique perspectives on things.\n\n\nDon't partner with local search firms that lack robust access to a global network.\n\n\nEthical Practices and Confidentiality\n\n\nExecutive search firms are known for their ethical practices and confidential handling of sensitive information. You must choose a firm that respects your request for confidentiality, adheres to the highest ethical standards, and respects the privacy of executives and clients.\n\n\nWhen hiring a search firm, you must not hesitate to ask about its data security process, conflict-of-interest policies, and commitment to upholding the utmost discretion throughout the search process.\n\n\nPower Up Your Growth With Taplow\n\n\nNow that you know how to select the best executive search firm for your organization, you must also know how to go forward from here.\n\n\nWhat if we say you get 150+ global search experts across America, Asia Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East who can help your organization unlock its growth potential?

Nevertheless, this short guide will tell you exactly the situations and reasons for hiring someone for a temporary leadership role.\n\n\nAlso, if your organization feels stuck in a rut and the board of directors and other management teams feel the need for temporary leadership, then you can immediately connect with a C-suite hiring firm, which can help you hire and get back on track.\n\n\n4 Key Reasons Why an Organization Needs an Interim Manager\n\n\nSeamless Continuity\n\n\nWhen a key position is left unoccupied in an organization, it can create a void that may lead to disrupted workflow. The temporary leader comes in to ensure that the operations are properly functioning and that operations continue without any pauses or interruptions in the normal workflow in your organization.\n\n\nExpertise on Demand\n\n\nAbove all, an organization must avoid making a mistake in hiring an \nexecutive search firm\n to get them the best interim leader. Interim leaders help a lot with their many years of experience and particular savviness. Those veteran consultants have a broad knowledge acquired from various areas and firms. They are highly attentive and creative in solving specific problems, and this brings invaluable advice to the table. When you replace the long-term leader with a temporary one, you acquire a broader vision and a group of skills tailored to your circumstances.\n\n\nObjectivity and Impartiality\n\n\nBeing an outsider, a temporary leader might as well provide a far-sighted and detached perspective on your operations, activities, procedures, and traditions, which is the closest point of view to a third party’s. Moreover, they are able to detect loopholes in the process and propose unbiased suggestions, thus facilitating the implementation without being affected by emotions, biases, or agendas.\n\n\nFresh Perspectives and Change Management\n\n\nIt may happen that the company is in a state of stagnation or inflexibility regarding adaptation to new conditions. Their main function would be to move the organization forward, adopt a new vision, and change the process, strategy, and culture. These incidental staff will, over time, provide excellent tools to bring about a transition process in your entity.\n\n\nSituations When You Need an Interim Manager\n\n\nLeadership Transition\n\n\nWhen a company loses its key managerial staff, an \nInterim Manager\n is hired to prevent the business from falling apart until a replacement is found. For about six months or so, while the organization is going through the process of recruiting a new leader, the interim leader takes the responsibility of maintaining and monitoring the daily operations and strategic management.\n\n\nOrganizational Restructuring or Mergers\n\n\nAn interim leader is much needed when the organization is going through significant restructuring or combining with another organization to oversee the whole process and the management of it. They have a neutral view and extensive experience, which makes their process of navigating through complex organizational changes. Hence, the change would be smooth and would make sure significant operational hiccups would not happen.\n\n\nRapid Growth or Expansion\n\n\nWhen the organization experiences rapid growth or expansion, ad hoc leadership gaps might form because of work pressure and new projects. A Transitional leader can bridge these gaps, provide strategic guidance, and oversee business operations when the business is in a growing phase. Thus, the organization harvests its opportunities during a good time.\n\n\nTurnaround or Crisis Management\n\n\nIn the event of a financial challenge or crisis, or when an organization wants to be handled by a turnaround strategy, an interim leader’s expertise can really be valuable. Equipped with an objective, result-oriented approach and gained experience in crisis management, they can control operations by developing and implementing corrective strategies and reaching profitable results.\n\n\nSpecial Projects or Initiatives\n\n\nWhen the strategy is to perform a particular project or functional initiative whereby specialized expertise and some project management skills are required, the temporary leader is the right and best solution to adopt. The manner in which their processes and staff members are focused is perfect for complex projects. They deliver successfully and on time without overstretching the existing staff.\n\n\nTemporary Absence of Key Personnel\n\n\nWhen executives or managers leave, for example, parental or medical leave, an Interim leadership team can be an alternative and yet very useful option, especially to maintain important leadership presence and decision-making operations. Thus, it is possible to avoid any operational lag or inconsistencies during absence and to keep the organization functioning without hindrance.\n\n\nChange Management\n\n\nDue to the excessive number of barriers, organizational changes frequently encounter stances, and challenge management becomes the main tool for the successful implementation of innovation. The \nInterim Manager\n, alongside his change management know-how, heads and supports change within the organization, successfully deals with the parts of the crowd resisting changes and ensures a change of state.\n\n\nSubject Matter Expertise\n\n\nWhen an organization possesses a specific technical/industrial area’s expertise/knowledge, temporary leaders who are experienced in the same disciplines can fill the gap. They can help foster the growth of the staff by providing training, mentorship, and guidance. Thus, it assists in keeping the organization able to compete on different levels and employ all the best practices from the industry.\n\n\nObjective Third-Party Perspective\n\n\nThe main reason for the request is to provide the organization with an unbiased, impartial assessment of its operations, functions, and practices to indicate the fields for improvement. An Interim leader, as an outsider with no preconceived notions, can provide valuable recommendations and facilitate objective decision-making processes.\n\n\nAvoid Costly Hiring Mistakes\n\n\nWe at Taplow Group believe that an organization cannot operate efficiently if it hires the wrong C-suite professional. This is why an organization must outsource C-suite and interim management hiring to an efficient \ncommunication sector consultancy\n with extensive experience in hiring and managing these functions efficiently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2133)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "The Role of Emotional Intelligence in CEO Effectiveness\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nSunday, March 17, 2024\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a CEO, your emotional intelligence is an integral factor toward your success, as much as being a thorough businessman and strategist. The capability of emotional intelligence is being able to identify, understand, and take charge of emotions—your own and those of others.\n\n\nIf you can identify your emotional triggers and biases, you do so with their influence. The effectiveness of EI comes into play when you can show your people how to encourage them and generate an atmosphere of trust, openness & productivity.\n\n\nUnderstanding Emotional Intelligence\n\n\nEmotional intelligence is simply the ability to be aware, understand, and control feelings – be they yours or others around you. It is a majestic power that a CEO wields to get through complex interpersonal relationships, communicate, and make sound decisions quickly and effectively.\n\n\nCore Components of Emotional Intelligence & its Significance\n\n\nNow, let's explore the significance of each component in effective leadership:\n\n\nSelf-awareness\n\n\nIt is a state of being when you admit your emotional triggers, biases, and blind spots to make calculated and purposeful decisions as a team leader and make true to yourself. It is the pillar for a continuous foundation of self-improvement and development.\n\n\nSelf-management\n\n\nNowadays, self-managing is an absolute necessity. As a CEO, you should know how to control your emotions, which will help you to stay calm and collected. Therefore, you can think clearly and answer appropriately to the challenges instead of reacting impulsively emotionally.\n\n\nSocial awareness\n\n\nWith leadership, your perception and comprehension of the emotions of your team, stakeholders, and customers can bring out that niche in the competition. It values deep relations, quality communication, and knowledge that considers human factors in decision-making.\n\n\nRelationship management\n\n\nLeadership that delivers is compelling and informing other people. Emotional intelligence helps you develop strong and positive relationships with others, leading to a united team that fully supports you by pooling their ideas and efforts to achieve your goals.\n\n\nIn today's competitive and dynamic business climate, emotional intelligence (EI) is no longer a necessary talent for survival; it is now a must for any CEO hoping to lead and succeed. \nHuman capital\n firms like Taplow group can help you win your emotions as a CEO and lead the complicated web of interpersonal interactions, and motivate others to achieve.\n\n\nThe Impact of EI on Key CEO Responsibilities\n\n\nEmotional intelligence can be the key competence of an effective and successful CEO. The more you develop your EI skills, the more you can excel at management of all areas of leadership, from strategic decision-making to crisis resolution and many other things.\n\n\nStrategic Decision-Making\n\n\nAs a CEO, your strategic decisions drive your organization's success. Here, emotional intelligence comes to the fore, having you manage the intricate web of emotions, biases, and competing interests that often blur the judgment.\n\n\nThrough enhanced awareness of yourself, you'll be able to detect triggers of your emotions as well as your blind spots, and then you can make decisions from a straightforward, objective mindset. Finally, your social awareness enables you to realize different points of view and emotional motivations of your employees, stakeholders, and customers. Hence, you make better choices, taking into consideration all interests.\n\n\nBuilding High-Performing Teams\n\n\nAs a leader, you are not just responsible towards your stakeholders or organization, but you also hold the responsibility to encourage, empower & inspire your team. And EI is the key that helps you inspire & build a cohesive, motivated & high-performing team in your organization.\n\n\nThrough self-management abilities, you can become a role model for others while keeping your stability and strength under any circumstances. Your gut feeling for how to tune into the emotional dimension of your teammates builds trust, respect, and belongingness that leads to high collaboration and performance. If you are going through a transitional phase then an \ninterim management\n firm can guide and groom you for the next big opportunity. \n\n\nEffective Communication\n\n\nAs a CEO, your words carry power, and how effectively and correctly you communicate could make or break your organization's success. Emotional intelligence will enable you to address appropriate messaging to your audiences, such as employees, investors, and media.\n\n\nUnderstanding why people behave the way they do and how to interpret their emotions increases awareness of society. Moreover, it informs their method of communication. A combination of leadership skills helps you convey the message convincingly, succinctly, and credibly to appeal to the people around you.\n\n\nCrisis Management\n\n\nA crisis will likely occur in a highly dynamic and sometimes unpredictable commercial environment. Overcoming or dealing with such problems can make or break your organization's strength and reputation. Emotional intelligence is the key to success in a world of unpredictable storms. Due to the higher degree of self-control one will have accomplished, emotions will not move you, but you will be able to think straight and make tough decisions.\n\n\nYour social awareness enables you to pick on the emotional background and respond with empathy, letting the other parties know that you care and calming down your staff. In addition, establishing and maintaining close connections by using effective communication and interpersonal skills could be very beneficial in handling crises, adapting, and becoming a winner.\n\n\nWrapping Up\n\n\nEmotional intelligence is an essential factor in managers' success, and it helps leaders comprehend and handle interpersonal dynamics suitably. Organizations like the Taplow Group recognize that emotional intelligence is a critical skill in leadership roles and is always available for \nCEO training\n programs and the selection of top management and succession planning programs in your organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3234)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

However, it's tricky and challenging for an organization to single-handedly identify & hire talents, especially when they need to fill critical positions. This is where an organization realizes the importance of an \nexecutive search\n firm.\n\n\nIdentifying & hiring top-level talent is a strategic process that isn't just about finding skilled executives; it's more about meticulously vetting and securing the best talent whose vision aligns with the organization and can drive the desired growth. An organization must partner up with the right executive firm with access to a world of exceptional candidates perfectly aligned with your company's unique needs and culture.\n\n\nLet's understand the importance of search firms in depth.\n\n\nThe High Stakes of Hiring Top Executives\n\n\nAs an organization, if you think hiring top-level executives is just another traditional hiring process, go down the wrong route. High stakes are attached to hiring top-level executives; it can have massive implications for any organization's future. If you have partnered with a \nhuman capital\n firm, rest assured they will get your organization an individual who will steer your ship, make critical decisions, and shape the culture that drives your organization forward.\n\n\nTalking about the high stakes, what if you have hired a C-suite executive for your organization who lacks the vision, skills, or values to lead your company toward greatness? It will not just stop your organization's growth but also will undo the years of progress.\n\n\nOn the other side, if your organization has onboarded a visionary leader who possesses the technical expertise and intangible qualities – like unwavering integrity, contagious passion, and the ability to inspire- you can help your organization grow to new levels of success.\n\n\nWith so many stakes put on these top-talent hires, can you afford to leave it to chance? No right? This is a significant reason your organization must partner with a seasoned search firm and leverage its vast networks.\n\n\nThe Advantages of Executive Search Firms\n\n\nNow that you have understood the stakes of hiring top talents, you must also know the key advantages of partnering up with an \nexecutive search\n firm. Below are the benefits these firms offer:\n\n\nDeep Networks and Market Expertise\n\n\nExecutive search firms are just hiring firms, which is a pure myth. They are well-connected with the active & passive top talents of your industry. This is a significant advantage of joining hands with a search firm; their extensive networks and deep market knowledge can help you get the most desirable executive for your organization who might have flown under your radar. These firms go beyond the ordinary & secure the most sought-after executives for your organization.\n\n\nMeticulous Candidate Screening and Assessment\n\n\nTraditional hiring firms' work is mostly limited to resume screening, which differs from search firms. These firms go beyond the surface & thoroughly vet the C-suite candidates to assess their cultural fit, leadership potential, and long-term viability within your organization. They have an established screening & hiring process that includes multiple in-depth interviews and reference checks that ensure you see the candidate's clear picture before making a critical hiring decision.\n\n\nStreamlined Process and Time Efficiency\n\n\nOn top of everything, hiring a top-level executive is quite a hectic and time-consuming process, especially when you're already juggling a million other responsibilities. The search firms take that burden off your shoulders of recruiting, screening & onboarding the candidate with laser-focused efficiency. Not just this, the search firms also negotiate on behalf of your organization so that you can focus on running your business. Additionally, you can connect with these firms for \nCEO training\n if you have already recruited a top-level executive.\n\n\nTransparency & Confidentiality\n\n\nHaving complete control of confidentiality is crucial when you are hiring a top-level talent for your organization. Every organization wants to keep these hirings under the wraps of their competitors or the media houses. Search firms like Taplow Group follow the process with the utmost transparency and confidentiality and ensure your strategic hiring plans remain confidential until you're ready to make an announcement.\n\n\nAfter all this learning, is hiring a C-suite executive a top game and should be done only by established professionals? Visit \nTaplowgroup.com\n and experience the difference. With our deep expertise, meticulous approach, and commitment to discretion, we are always by your side to attract and secure the elite talent your organization deserves.\n\n\nKey Considerations When Choosing an Executive Search Partner\n\n\nEven when you hire an intern, you sit with a checklist, right? When it comes to partnering with a human capital firm, you must consider some things before joining hands with them.\n\n\nFirst, assess their industry expertise. Expertise makes or breaks the game; evaluate their knowledge and talent pool (If possible). Next, as an organization, you must determine its track record and reputation in the industry.\n\n\nAfter evaluating the expertise and track record, you must inquire about their process and approach. Your organization must partner with a firm that deeply understands your organization's values and vision.\n\n\nWrapping Up\n\n\nWith so many search firms, picking one can be pretty confusing. But when you are keen to fill a critical position and drive your organization towards growth, you must choose the one with the expertise you are looking for. At Taplow Group, we are always on our toes to help organizations and get them the best executive for their business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2126)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

It's the \nHuman Capital Management\n (HCM). Today, the only organizations that are growing exceptionally are those that understand the value of their people and know how they can effectively plan their human capital strategies.\n\n\nOrganizations that are not putting their people first or don't value them as assets struggle to attract the top talents or retain their valuable coworkers. Now, suppose you feel this blog is not for you. In that case, you may be wrong because whether you're a professional business leader or an aspiring professional, you must master the art of HCM to foster a high-performing and future-ready workforce.\n\n\nLet's understand everything about the human capital and how it works. This guide will tell you how to master HCM and navigate the complex talent management landscape.\n\n\nWhat is Human Capital Management?\n\n\nSimply put, \nhuman capital consulting\n is a more strategic & modernized approach to traditional resource management. They invest in developing the organization's assets (The people) and drive business values.\n\n\nHCM consultants are more like strategic partners who help organizations design and implement plans to develop their workforce, boost engagement, and drive business value. They work with organizations to identify their needs and craft tailored strategies that empower people to contribute their best, be more productive, and innovate.\n\n\nHuman Resource Management VS Human Capital Management\n\n\nHere's a detailed explanation of HRM and HCM and how they are different:\n\n\nHuman Resource Management (HRM)\n\n\nHuman resource management caters to a broad range of organizational activities, like managing the workforce, recruiting, training, evaluating performance, and looking into compensation and employee relations.\n\n\nHuman resource consulting firms\n are the backbone that helps organizations attract, retain, and develop skilled individuals. It also fosters a positive work environment that aligns with the organization's business objectives and builds an experienced and motivated workforce.\n\n\nSpecific organizations leverage \nhuman resource management system\n to manage their resources/workforces.\n\n\nHuman Capital Management (HCM)\n\n\nFYI, HRM used to be the backbone of an organization as it is a traditional approach to the organization's workforce growth. On the other hand, HCM is a more strategic and holistic approach to workforce management.\n\n\nHCM recognizes that an organization's employees are not just resources but valuable capital that drives success & growth. The critical functions of human capital include developing and nurturing human capital strategy through talent acquisition, learning and development, performance management, and succession planning.\n\n\nHCM strategies help organizations cultivate a culture of continuous learning, enhance employee engagement, and align the workforce with long-term business goals. HCM empowers organizations to maximize the potential of human capital and ensures that the organization remains competitive and future-ready.\n\n\nToday, HCM strategies are relevant to gain a competitive edge and can help you \nmaximize organizational success\n . You must invest in your human capital for long-term success and growth as an organization.\n\n\nComponents of Human Capital Consulting\n\n\nHuman Capital is a holistic approach, which includes several interconnected elements:\n\n\nTalent Acquisition\n\n\nTo the organization, hiring the right people is of great importance. HCM allows you to craft an effective recruitment strategy and utilizes cutting-edge tools and techniques to find, measure, and bring in culturally aligned people with similar goals to your company. It helps you develop a solid pool of talents to win in the long run.\n\n\nLearning and Development\n\n\nEmployee development is one of the main pillars of HCM. Through efficient training and development, organizations can upskill employees, further advancement and encourage constant learning. This leads to increased employee engagement and retention and makes your organization knowledgeable enough to handle the changing dynamics of the market.\n\n\nPerformance Management\n\n\nHCM allows you to create a structure where targets are established, evaluations are done regularly, and feedback is given constructively. By setting up objectives accompanying both individual and team objectives with organizational goals, you can attest that your workforce remains motivated, productive, and focused on reaching the intended outcomes. Efficient performance management is fundamental for motivation and identifying strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\nSuccession Planning\n\n\nDeveloping the future is the main issue requiring one to have succession plans that identify and nurture high-performing employees for leadership positions. Through the development of internal staff and career advancement opportunities, you can create a robust leadership pipeline that will not only ensure smooth transitions during times of change but also help minimize operational disruptions.\n\n\nHow Human Capital Management Transforms Workplaces?\n\n\nHCM works wonders for organizations; here are some ways \nhow it benefits organizations\n :\n\n\nAttracting and Retaining Top Talent\n\n\nWith the highly competitive staff market worldwide, businesses need to strive to be the employers of choice to succeed. HCM teaches you how to create a beautiful employer brand, simplify recruitment processes, and implement an effective onboarding system.\n\n\nYou can compete in the industry by developing competitive compensation, growth opportunities, and a healthy work culture. You do this to be an employer of choice that will help you attract the best people and reduce the cost of employee turnover.\n\n\nEnhancing Employee Engagement and Productivity\n\n\nThose who are highly involved are the engines of any winning company. HCM will enable you to create a communication-oriented culture where employees will be recognized and the work-life balance will be achieved.\n\n\nYou can create a purposeful workforce that will sync with the company's objectives by completing performance management systems that will give regular feedback, coaching, and development activities. Employees who are highly valued, appreciated, and involved in growth can do more things in a productive, innovative way to be committed to the success of your organization.\n\n\nNurturing a Culture of Continuous Learning\n\n\nIn our currently complex business surroundings, permanent learning is vitally needed to stay competitive. By HRMS, you can develop and tailor learning and development programs that meet the particular learning needs of your organization.\n\n\nBy setting up training opportunities and mentorship programs and using advanced learning tools, you can make employees skilled and knowledgeable enough to keep in line with changing market needs by innovating and being ready for the future.\n\n\nAligning Talent with Strategic Goals\n\n\nSuccessful HCM activities enable matching your human resources with the overall business strategy of your organization. With succession planning and talent management policies in place, you will be able to select strong candidates, build leadership pipelines, and achieve smooth business transitions during times of change.\n\n\nThis alignment not only gives way to operational efficiency and increases employee engagement through purpose and vision but also creates an environment for organizations to flourish.\n\n\nFostering Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\n\nA diverse and inclusive workforce is neither a moral choice alone nor a mere matter of business. HCM is uniquely positioned to help organizations build a culture that encourages diversity, equality, and inclusivity so that each employee is appreciated and treated with dignity and respect.\n\n\nBy adopting fair and bias-free talent management approaches, encouraging unhindered and equitable professional growth and development, and creating a sense of belonging, you can harness a highly skilled talent pool, nurture innovation, and forge a vibrant environment where everyone can excel.\n\n\nKey Challenges of Human Capital Management\n\n\nSignificant critical challenges of an HCM:\n\n\nAttracting and Retaining Top Talent\n\n\nIn today's job market, where competition amongst organizations is challenging, it becomes even more difficult for companies to get and keep great people. You must always focus on providing competitive pay, personal development avenues, and a workplace culture that becomes emotionally attached to both current employees and potential candidates.\n\n\nAddressing Skills Gaps\n\n\nWith the industries changing and new technologies being unleashed, you will need more skills in the workforce. Addressing these gaps through the provision of the proper training and development opportunities remains a strenuous and time-consuming activity but is also very important for the organization since it ensures that every employee is equipped with the required skills that will drive organizational success.\n\n\nManaging a Multigenerational Workforce\n\n\nIt becomes challenging when various generations work together; hence, navigating within the particular needs, expectations, and communication patterns of the generations is vital. Developing methods to encourage collaboration, exchanging knowledge, and creating a feeling of being together despite multigenerational teams is difficult.\n\n\nPromoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\n\nCreating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace is a long and arduous process that encompasses eliminating biases, creating equal opportunities, and fostering a culture of respect and belonging. Addressing the conscious and unconscious prejudices, providing fair talent management practices, and contributing to an inclusive environment are the most significant challenges.\n\n\nAligning Talent with Strategic Goals\n\n\nCombining the strengths of talents in your human capital while maintaining the strategic goals and objectives of the organization is challenging. Strategic implementation of harmony in talent management, succession planning, and performance management systems, which leads to alignment, is complex and needs thorough planning and performance.\n\n\nLeveraging Data and Analytics\n\n\nIn an age where data and analytics drive decision-making, using data and analytics as a strategy may be very complex. Gathering, analyzing, and interpreting existing data to back up given decisions is also generally tricky. Here are some \ntips to build a solid partnership with HCM firms\n :\n\n\nStep-by-Step Guide to Implementing HCM\n\n\nEnsuring the success of an effective Human Capital Management (HCM) strategy is solely based on how this process is thoughtfully planned and implemented. Here's a step-by-step guide to help your organization:\n\n\nStep 1: Define Your HCM Vision and Goals\n\n\nYour organization should come forth with what it wants to achieve for internal and external customers.

Collect feedback from employees, leaders, and stakeholders to get an overall view of your staff's capacity for HCM.\n\n\nStep 3: Develop a Comprehensive HCM Strategy (50 words)\n\n\nConsidering your ideology, goal, and what you have already assessed, create a general HCM strategy outlining how you will roll out the programs, plan, and policies. Classify the issues in the order of importance and design Gantt charts to set up the deadlines, budget, and other resources accordingly.\n\n\nStep 4: Invest in HCM Technology and Tools\n\n\nIncorporate the present-day HCM technology and tools to simplify the processes, upgrade data-driven decision-making, and improve talent management. Find the ways for recruitment, performance management, learning and development, and analytics. Ensure your application seamlessly integrates with your current platforms to provide a harmonious experience.\n\n\nStep 5: Build a Culture of Continuous Learning and Development\n\n\nCreate an atmosphere supporting constant learning and professional improvement. Construct skill-based training avenues, incorporate mentorship programs, and enable knowledge-sharing channels. Fostering a learning culture where employees adopt a growth mindset is essential to keep their training level up to the industry's demands.\n\n\nStep 6: Measure, Analyze, and Optimize\n\n\nAttach the metrics of success (KPIs) to your HCM initiatives to measure their inputs. Following this up, conduct periodic data analysis and seek input from key partners to identify areas for enhancement. Adaptability and speed are vital, so you should change your HCM strategy whenever necessary to maximize the results and permanently improve the organization.\n\n\nFuture of HCM\n\n\nThe future of HCM relies primarily on AI and ML functions. The organization must align with the future, learn and apply the latest digital transformations, and incorporate cutting-edge technologies to compete against competitors.\n\n\nMachine learning, Artificial intelligence, Augmented reality, and Virtual reality are not just a fantasy; they are already here. These technologies are set to change how organizations attract, develop, and retain top talent.\n\n\nFurthermore, organizations must employ practical virtual collaboration tools, high-performing talent management systems, and innovative employee engagement techniques to create a one and connected workforce.\n\n\nBeing on the verge of the future now, you as an enterprise must connect with experienced professionals to proceed with the current trends appropriately.

It is often conducted by external firms or consultants who have access to a network of qualified candidates and industry insights. Executive search can help organizations fill critical roles that require specific skills, experience, or leadership qualities. It can also help attract passive candidates who are not actively looking for a job but might be open to new opportunities.\n\n\nIn this guide, you will learn the basics of executive search, such as:\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the benefits of executive search?\n\n\nHow to choose the right executive search firm or consultant for your needs?\n\n\nDifference between executive search and recruitment agencies\n\n\nSteps involved in the executive search process\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this guide, you will have a better understanding of executive search and how it can help you find the best talent for your organization.\n\n\nWhat is Executive Search?\n\n\nExecutive search, often referred to as headhunting, is a specialized recruitment service aimed at identifying\n\n\nand attracting top-level professionals for key leadership positions within organizations. Unlike traditional recruitment, executive search focuses on recruiting candidates for executive, managerial, or other senior roles.\n\n\nThe process begins with a thorough understanding of the client's organizational needs, corporate culture, and specific requirements for the executive role. Executive search consultants, also known as headhunters, leverage their industry expertise, extensive networks, and research skills to identify potential candidates who align with the client's criteria.\n\n\nConfidentiality is a hallmark of executive search, ensuring that the client's intentions to fill a key position or explore new leadership are kept private until a suitable candidate is found. This approach allows organizations to manage leadership transitions smoothly and minimize any potential disruptions.\n\n\nWho needs Executive Search Services?\n\n\nExecutive search services are crucial for organizations across industries that are seeking to fill high-level leadership positions with exceptional talent. These services are especially valuable when companies are aiming to secure executives for key roles where the impact of leadership is critical to the success and growth of the business.\n\n\nLarge corporations often turn to executive search services when looking for CEOs, CFOs, CTOs, and other top-tier executives. These organizations recognize the importance of having visionary leaders with proven track records to drive strategic initiatives and navigate complex business landscapes.\n\n\nMid-sized companies looking to expand or undergo strategic transformations also benefit from executive search. These services help identify leaders who can bring fresh perspectives, innovation, and the expertise needed to execute growth strategies effectively.\n\n\nStartups seeking to establish a strong leadership foundation frequently engage in executive search to locate founders, CEOs, or executives with the industry knowledge and entrepreneurial spirit required to guide the company through its early stages and scale operations.\n\n\nAdditionally, organizations undergoing leadership transitions, whether due to retirement, restructuring, or succession planning, rely on executive search services to ensure a seamless and effective transfer of leadership, minimizing disruptions and maintaining business continuity.\n\n\nExecutive Search vs. Recruitment Agencies\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriteria\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecutive Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecruitment Agencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel of roles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior, executive, or highly specialized positions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntry, mid, or lower-level management positions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType of candidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassive candidates who are not actively looking for a job\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive candidates who are seeking a new job\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetained or exclusive, meaning they work with one client per role and charge a fee regardless of the outcome\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContingent or non-exclusive, meaning they work with multiple clients per role and charge a fee only if they successfully fill the role\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethodology\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProactive and strategic, involving research, outreach, assessment, and negotiation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReactive and transactional, involving posting, screening, and shortlisting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpertise\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustry or function-specific, with deep knowledge and a network of the market\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneralist or broad, with access to a large pool of candidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValue proposition\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality and fit, ensuring the best match for both the role and the company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeed and quantity, ensuring the fastest and most efficient way to fill the role\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nStep by Step Process of Executive Search Hiring\n\n\nLet's break down the steps to make sure companies get leaders who match their goals.\n\n\n1. Talking with the Client:\n\n\nFirst, the executive search team talks with the company to understand its culture and what kind of leader they're looking for. This sets the stage for a plan tailored to the company's needs.\n\n\n2. Listing the Job:\n\n\nThen, a detailed job description is created. This document outlines exactly what skills and qualities the ideal leader should have, acting as a guide for the search.\n\n\n3. Finding People:\n\n\nNow, armed with the job details, the search team uses their connections and knowledge to find potential leaders. They carefully research and pinpoint individuals who fit the bill.\n\n\n4. Talking to People:\n\n\nThe search team reaches out to potential leaders privately and respectfully to see if they're interested in the position. Keeping things confidential is crucial during this step.\n\n\n5. Checking Them Out:\n\n\nThe team thoroughly checks potential leaders through interviews, assessments, and talking to people who know them. This ensures that the candidates not only have the right skills but also fit well in the company.\n\n\n6. Showing the Best Ones:\n\n\nThe search team then presents a shortlist of the best candidates to the company. This way, the company can review and choose from a carefully selected group.\n\n\n7. Company Interviews:\n\n\nNext, the company meets with the shortlisted candidates to get to know them better. This step helps the company make sure they pick the right person for the job.\n\n\n8. Making Offers:\n\n\nOnce the company decides on a candidate, the search team helps with the job offer and negotiation. They make sure both the company and the candidate are happy with the deal.\n\n\n9. Starting the Job:\n\n\nThe search team supports the new leader during their early days on the job, providing information and helping to make sure they settle in smoothly.\n\n\n10. Keeping in Touch:\n\n\nAfter the new leader starts, the \nsearch team stays in touch with both the company and the new leader\n. This helps deal with any challenges and ensures a good working relationship.\n\n\nAdvantages of Working with Top Executive Search Firms\n\n\nTop-Tier Talent Acquisition: Executive search and

This is why more companies are turning to specialist communication sector consultancy to optimize their outreach.\n\n\nIn this modern era, these consultants have become integral partners in enhancing corporate communication and positioning for deeper connection and impact across diverse audiences. The consultancies empower businesses to cut through noise and meaningfully reach their audiences.\n\n\nThis article will tell you how these consultancies help your business reach a massive audience.\n\n\nWhat is Communication Sector Consultancy?\n\n\nCommunication consultancy refers to advisory services offered by consultants to help businesses effectively connect and engage with important stakeholder groups, including customers, employees, investors, media, and the general public. Communication consultants are experienced professionals who provide strategic guidance and services across a spectrum of outreach channels and specializations.\n\n\nYou can find many global executive search firms that specialize in marketing communication, branding, public relations, investor relations, change management communication, crisis communication, government affairs communication, and internal organizational communication.\n\n\nThe services offered by these consultants are strategic messaging development, content creation, brand positioning, storytelling, campaign execution, relationship building, executive communications training, and crisis mitigation.\n\n\nCommunication consultants involve themselves in the client’s culture and ecosystem in order to enhance their resonance and visibility where it matters most through informed communication principles.\n\n\nKey Areas Where Communication Consultancy Helps Businesses\n\n\nHere’s how a \nglobal executive search\n firm that also specializes in communication helps your business:\n\n\nDeveloping a Clear Communication Strategy\n\n\nCommunication consultants help companies create comprehensive strategies with defined objectives, core messaging themes, ideal channels, and engagement tactics per stakeholder group.\n\n\nAn external perspective lends objectivity to messaging clarity, platform prioritization, and establishing processes for efficient, consistent communication. Consultants become invaluable partners in strategically connecting business goals to communication outcomes.\n\n\nOptimizing Communication Channels and Tools\n\n\nMyriad channels exist today for reaching audiences; however, not all align with brand identities or best foster stakeholder connections. Consultants analyze existing communication channels and guide the integration of new tools and technologies to unify, expand reach, and heighten engagement.\n\n\nFrom website functionality audits to tailoring CEO speeches for live versus digital events, communication advisors optimize how companies interface with the priority public. Consultancies also support leaders, such as developing a \nCEO training program\n on leveraging owned media for thought leadership positioning.\n\n\nBoosting Brand Awareness and Reputation\n\n\nStrategic communication centered on brand building and reputation management leads to increased discoverability and trust over time. Communication consultants are brand clarity catalysts who help express purpose and values cohesively across touchpoints.\n\n\nConsultancies also provide outsider objectivity to advise how brands are perceived, recommend reputation enhancement strategies, and help leaders better evoke affinity through messaging and presence congruent with a brand’s persona.\n\n\nImproving Employee Engagement and Internal Communication\n\n\nOngoing internal communication and emotionally intelligent outreach to employees underlie an organization’s health. Communication consultants assess current strategies and offer recommendations to humanize leadership relations, streamline critical information sharing, and elevate the employee experience and connectivity to the company mission.\n\n\nEnhanced internal communication is a critical driver in catalyzing workforce solidarity, purpose, and excellence. Consultants provide invaluable guidance for organizational harmony and success.\n\n\nCrisis and Risk Communications\n\n\nDuring turbulent times, communication consultancy proves invaluable for organizational stability and reputation management. When confronted by PR crises, scandals, or events garnering negative publicity, consultants guide leaders in crafting judicious public responses.\n\n\nThey also provide intensive spokesperson coaching for leaders thrust unexpectedly into media spotlights. Their experience broadens the executive perspective to address unfolding situations deliberately yet empathetically while protecting corporate interests long-term.\n\n\nChange Management Communication\n\n\nCommunication consultants work closely with change management teams and company leaders to develop phased communication plans supporting the successful adoption of changes. Consultants proactively prepare leaders, coaches, and internal communicators for two-way dialogue through predicted periods of uncertainty, fear, denial, and integration challenges.\n\n\nThey also advise how to frame external messaging best when substantial change intersects public perception. Communication consultants enable organizations undergoing systemic change to strategically guide internal culture and external opinions through the crucible, arriving intact on the other side.\n\n\nHow Taplow Group Can Help You?\n\n\nAs an award-winning communications consultancy, Taplow Group offers end-to-end guidance to businesses that are looking to improve their messaging and engagement with critical audiences. Taplow provides research-based communication strategies, branding expertise, campaign creation, crisis management, coaching for leaders as spokespersons, and measurable tracking of communication program effectiveness.\n\n\nWe at Taplow offer a professional CEO training program for senior leadership.

The increase in interest rates has been consistent from a historical low of 0.10% per annum with 12 consecutive rises (four 0.50% increases and eight 0.25% increases), taking the cash rate to 4.35%.\n\n\nInflation in Australia has passed its peak but is still too high and is proving more persistent than expected. CPI inflation is now expected to be around 3½ per cent by the end of 2024 and at the top of the target range of 2 to 3 per cent by the end of 2025.\n\n\nIn the final quarter of the 2023 year, the Federal Parliament passed industrial relations laws which substantially increased the burden and costs imposed on businesses using labour-hire arrangements and hurt productivity.\n\n\nNational Accounts (November 2023) indicated that Australia is in a GDP per capita recession, and under the current Government, mortgage repayments have almost tripled, prices have gone up by more than 9%, and taxes have gone up by over 27%.\n\n\nSources include: Australian Bureau of Statistics, Finspro, The Guardian, Reserve Bank of Australia, Angus Taylor MP.\n\n\nCHINA:\n\n\nGDP growth target of “around 4.5%” for 2024 set by China: \nAccording to Nomura China's macro 2024 outlook, Beijing may set a GDP growth target of “around 4.5%” for 2024, a touch below the “around 5.0%” for 2023. Many institutional investors have a similar prediction the GDP growth target ranges from 4% to 4.5%, which largely depends on the timing, probability, scale and format for Beijing to take the eventful step of directly intervening in the property sector.\n\n\nSlow recovery of China's Economy is foreseeable in the first quarter of 2024: In 2024, many Challenges have to be faced by China, such as lasting geopolitical tensions, delayed delivery of numerous homes, weaker external demand, lack of confidence for foreign investors,\n etc. Although the Chinese government will take many stimulus measures at the end of 2023, it is predictable that ‘the Winter is still coming’. The property sector may be the biggest and most significant factor dragging the recovery of China’s economy. Cash-strapped and insolvent developers have left a vast number of homes unfinished. This delayed delivery issue is key to any meaningful recovery in the coming quarters.\n\n\nPush factors for China to take more specific measures: \nLocal governments’ financial messes need to be cleaned up, and fiscal investment needs to be put in the right direction. Private entities need to take more involvement in the only state-owned sector previously. Local investors and foreign investors’ confidence needs to be strengthened. Geopolitical tensions, especially the Taiwan issue, need to be modified to raise the confidence of all entities, including foreign investors.\n\n\nImprovement in export is expected: \nExport growth is expected from an estimated -5.0% in 2023 to -1.5% in 2024. Consumer electronics and mobile phone exports may benefit from a potential global tech upswing. At the same time, low domestic inflation and the weak RMB could help China’s export sector maintain a competitive edge. However, the weak demand has to be taken seriously, which will slow down the turnover growth and damage the balance sheet of many Chinese enterprises. On the other side, weak external demand also limits inflation. It leaves more room for the China Central Bank’s money printing, which might be essential for rescuing many projects left unfinished by developers.\n\n\nINDIA: \n\n\nIndia is positioned to be the fastest-growing economy within the G20 group of nations, building on its remarkable economic performance. In the fiscal year 2022-23, the country experienced rapid economic growth, reaching 7.2%. The forecast for the fiscal year 2023-24 anticipates a growth rate of 6.9%. Notably, GDP growth remained robust at 7.6% year-over-year in the July-September quarter of 2023, following a growth of 7.8% in the April-June quarter (Economic Times).\n\n\nGDP Projection for 2024\n: According to S&P Global Ratings, India is poised for robust economic growth, with an estimated annual expansion of 6-7.1% in the fiscal years 2024-2026. The Reserve Bank of India also forecasts a 6.5% economic growth for the fiscal years 2023-24 and 2024-25, emphasizing the country's resilience to global economic fluctuations.\n\n\nInflation: \nMorgan Stanley projects a moderation in headline inflation to 4.9% in FY2025, while the Reserve Bank of India maintains its CPI inflation rate projection at 5.4% for the current fiscal year (2023-24). In its 'India 2024 outlook, Goldman Sachs anticipates headline inflation to persist above 5.1%, with core inflation resisting at 4.5% (Live Mint).\n\n\nGrowth Sectors: \nKey sectors such as steel, cement, commercial vehicles, and aviation have exhibited positive growth in the July-September quarter 2023. India's economic landscape is expected to maintain its upward trajectory, positioning it as one of the world's fastest-growing economies over the next decade.\n\n\nLong-Term Outlook: \nIndia's long-term economic outlook is underpinned by several growth drivers, including a large and fast-growing middle class, accelerating e-commerce through digital transformation, and robust Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows. Multinationals across diverse industries, from manufacturing to services, see India as a crucial long-term growth market (S&P Global).\n\n\nSectors Poised for Excellent Returns: \nInvestors are anticipated to find lucrative opportunities in healthcare, renewable energy, information technology, real estate, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), and the automobile industry (Groww).\n\n\nJob Market and Investment Inflows: \nIndia's job market is expected to grow substantially in 2024, particularly in sectors embracing artificial intelligence and data. The real estate sector, in particular, is projected to attract significant investment, making India a major destination for inflows in the Asia Pacific region (People Matters, The Hindu Business Line).\n\n\nCritical Sectors for Foreign Investors: \nIndia's appeal to foreign investors remains strong, with key sectors such as healthcare, fintech, renewable energy, IT, real estate, and R&D attracting significant attention. The relaxation of foreign direct investment (FDI) policies and production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes have further fuelled interest in these sectors (India Briefing).\n\n\nConclusion: \nIndia's economic landscape in 2024 presents a compelling narrative of sustained growth, supported by robust GDP projections, controlled inflation, flourishing sectors, and attractive investment opportunities. The nation's resilience and dynamic market conditions position it as a key global player.\n\n\nNEW ZEALAND:     \n\n\nOctober’s 2023 General Election delivered a change in New Zealand’s government, \nwith centre-right parties securing a majority of seats in parliament. The National Party will lead the new government, with agreed support from the ACT party and the New Zealand First party.\n\n\nThe change in government and policies in late 2023 \nwill have important implications for the economic landscape. Notable areas where the coalition partners agree include:\n\n\n•       Tax cuts/lifting of tax brackets.\n\n\n•       Easing of tax obligations on property investors\n\n\n•       Reduced regulatory burdens, focusing on the agricultural sector and less ambitious climate change policies.\n\n\n•       Focusing the RBNZ on inflation control rather than its current dual mandate.\n\n\nIn essence, the likely suite of policies will see a more minor role for government with lower taxes, less regulation and lower government spending. In terms of fiscal policy, it is likely to see the new government-run a similar (or slightly higher) operating balance as under the previous government but with roughly equal cuts to tax revenue and government expenditure.\n\n\nMore broadly, the new government’s policies are likely to be supportive of businesses. \nNotably, by reducing red tape, the new government aims to lower businesses’ costs and thus lift incomes while encouraging hiring and investment.\n\n\nWhile the change in government signals more remarkable restraint in spending over the next few years, governments of all stripes continue to face tougher, longer-term choices. New Zealand’s population is growing rapidly and ageing, increasing the demand for core public services, including spending on health, superannuation, and education. Also, in the short term, at least, high inflation is putting further pressure on government spending. Unless governments are prepared to run higher operating deficits and higher levels of debt, future budgets will likely require further cuts to spending and/or additional sources of revenue.\n\n\nThere’s been a sharp tightening in financial conditions over the past year\n, and that’s still expected to be a significant drag on demand. Adjusting for the impact of price changes, there has been no growth in per capita spending since the middle of last year.\n\n\nFinancial conditions are continuing to tighten\n, and that means the softness in spending is set to continue through the New Year. Increasing numbers of households will have to rewind their spending, and many others will do so out of caution. There’s likely weakness in interest rate-sensitive areas, like spending on furnishings and other household durables.\n\n\nThe pressure on households’ finances is coming through on two significant fronts\n. First are the continued large increases in living costs, eroding households’ spending power. Consumer prices rose by 5.6% over the past year, including significant increases in the cost of necessities. Every family across the country has felt those increases. Westpac expects inflation to persist and maintain pressure on household budgets. Second, household finances continue to be pressured by increases in debt servicing costs. Many borrowers have now rolled off the merger fixed mortgage rates onto much higher rates. Hence, households’ spending on debt servicing costs has increased. As many borrowers remain insulated from the rate rises, the average interest rate that borrowers are paying now has ‘only’ risen by 170bps. That’s still a significant rise but much less than the 525bp increase in the OCR since the start of the tightening cycle.\n\n\nOver the coming year, around 60% of all fixed-rate mortgages will come up for repricing.\n Importantly, with increased offshore funding costs pushing local borrowing rates higher in recent months, the rise in interest costs will now be more significant than Westpac had previously assumed. Westpac expects the average mortgage rate paid will rise by another 100bps over the coming year. Households with mortgages will see the share of their disposable incomes spent on interest costs rising to 20% by the end of next year (up from just 10% in 2022).\n\n\nHelping households to maintain their spending in the face of those mounting financial headwinds has been the strength of the jobs market. The past year has seen the number of people in employment rise by 4%, and average hourly earnings have risen by close to 7%. But while the labour market has remained in good health, it has started to soften. Businesses have scaled back their plans for hiring as economic growth has slowed, and the turnaround in net migration has seen the number of applicants per job rise. Unemployment is set to rise to 5.2% by the end of next year. Wage growth is also expected to slow gradually. Hence, weaker labour market conditions will reinforce the slowdown in household spending.\n\n\nSources include – Westpac New Zealand\n\n\nAMERICAS:\n\n\nBRAZIL:\n\n\nThe Brazilian Economy\n: It achieved a steady growth rate of 3% GDP in 2023, repeating 2022 under a new government formed in January 2023.\n\n\n2023 12-month inflation rate: \nReached 4.84%, 1.27% down, compared to last year (Oct. 2021 – Nov. 2022); current inflation target is 3.25%. The Central Bank of Brazil monitors and manages public economic policies concerning currency stability and inflation rates. The inflation target for 2024 is aimed at 3.00%.\n\n\nThe Brazilian Central Bank\n has adjusted the interest rate trend under a precautionary policy directly related to the current government spending policy, showing clear evidence to be kept at a high level due to the 2024 and 2026 election seasons. There is a consensus that a government administration reform should be made to reduce SELIC, the official interest rate, further and keep it reasonable.\n\n\n“Brazilian Drex”\n – After the success of “Pix”, the 24X7 cost-free instant bank local money transfer system introduced about two years ago, the Central Bank of Brazil will introduce the “Drex” – the digital version of the real currency, supported by the “blockchain” technology, which adds security to the financial operations preventing the occurrence of frauds.\n\n\nThis system, which brings all the facets of financial transactions under one unique, secure platform, will be in place in 2024.\n\n\n\n\nThe current unemployment rate is down to 7.7%, from previous two-digit rates a couple of years ago, after Covid-19. The current Brazilian workforce jumped to a population of over 100 million.\n\n\nTax Reform Law – After 30 years of discussions, Congress and the government promulgated the 2023 Tax Reform Laws, which will be enforced starting in 2024. Significant changes call for the creation of IVA – Imposto de Valor Agregado/Aggregated Value Tax/VAT, under a twofold tax structure: Creation of the IBS “Goods and Services Operation Tax”, replacing 5 Tax items (3 Federal + 1 State + 1 Municipal).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreation of CBS “Goods and Services Contribution” replacing a 6th Tax.\n\n\n\n\nThe objective was to simplify the complex and confusing tax system, eliminating the “Brazilian states tax war” and the current tax cascade effect.\n\n\nBrazil’s economy continues to rank 9th \namongst the 10 top worldwide economies, with a GNP exceeding 2.5 trillion Brazilian reais. The investment rate is slightly under 20% of GDP.\n\n\nAccording to the United States Department of Agriculture / USDA, Brazil was the world’s foremost producer of soybean, sugar, coffee and orange juice and the world’s major exporter of soybean, Sugar, coffee, corn, cellulose, tobacco, orange juice, beef and chicken meat.\n\n\nCANADA:\n\n\nDespite persistently high inflation and rising interest rates\n, the news was better than expected for the Canadian economy in 2023.\n\n\nAt this time last year, many economists wondered whether it could stop the Canadian economy from overheating without causing a recession. Though 1.1% growth for the Canadian economy in 2023 is slightly lower than the economy’s 2% potential, but still higher than initial forecasts.\n\n\nThe best news for 2024 is less uncertainty concerning interest rates\n. Canadians should find comfort that the most aggressive interest rate hikes in 40 years are ending. High-interest rates will continue to weigh on growth, but most of the slowdown has likely already occurred.\n\n\nThe Bank of Canada anticipates beginning to lower its key rate\n as early as this summer. However, the Bank will unlikely bring the rate down to 2.5%, the neutral level, before 2025. Rates will remain higher than those Canadians have been used to over the past 15 years.\n\n\nPast interest rate hikes will continue to limit Canadians discretionary spending. This will be especially pronounced in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec, where inflation increases and households are more indebted.\n\n\nThe slowdown will be less pronounced for commodities-oriented provinces\n. They rely less heavily on household spending. Alberta and Saskatchewan are set to grow above the national average in 2024.\n\n\nWith a well-diversified economy,\n Manitoba has always been less sensitive to cyclical disruptions. This current slowdown should not be any different. However, the pullback in Canada’s biggest markets (B.C., Ontario and Quebec) could dent Manitoba’s exports. Around 50% of the province’s exports are to other provinces.\n\n\nThe Atlantic provinces benefited from the substantial population increase \nexperienced at the national level in 2023. However, slower forecasted growth in the U.S. and China could weaken the region’s exports in 2024.\n\n\nThe Bank of Canada and the Fed are concerned about the tightening labour market\n. Last summer in Canada, unemployment was at a record low at 4.9%, and employers couldn’t find staff. The unemployment rate rose in the latter half of 2023 from 5% to 5.5%, and we expect it will continue to go up and peak at the end of 2024 at 6.6%\n\n\nSources include: BDC and Royal Bank of Canada\n\n\nUSA: \n\n\nAs we follow the analytical reports of the largest banks, including Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, as well as S&P (Standard & Poor’s), to the extent we can tease out of their reports – the following represents a degree of concurrence which seems to be now apparent.\n\n\nForecasts are varied, but the consensus from the most respected analysis suggests\n solid US consumer spending driven by continued real personal income gains and sustained private investment will underscore a reasonably steady pace of growth at or near the 1.8% long-run rate in the United States in 2024.  We note that month-to-month variances are highly likely as there is no viable current consensus over the pace of the recovery.\n\n\nThere are thoughts that policy tailwinds from both the fiscal and monetary authorities\n will set the stage for solid productivity and growth in the year ahead as inflation eases back to a much more tolerable 2.5% to 3% range, which is already reflected in recent economic activity and may be showing signs of further moderation.\n\n\nThe leading indicator that we watch is the Federal Funds Policy Rate analysis. So far, there is a relatively consistent analysis forecasting four 25 basis-point cuts in the federal fund’s policy rate starting as early as June 2024, which would bring it into a range between 4.25% to 4.5% by the end of the year with the risk of a lower rate growth rate triggering an earlier rate reduction.\n\n\nFor gross domestic product\n, the baseline forecast consensus expects a modest easing in growth following the torrid 2.9% year-ago pace in the third quarter of 2023. Growth will then rise to at or above the apparent consensus trend of 1.8% in the second half of 2024 and possibly accelerate into 2025.\n\n\nEmployment growth is not as straightforward \nas it is readily apparent that the most significant growth employers will likely try to trim costs by reducing employment and occupancy costs as leases come up for renewal. At least some landlords expect they can increase rental costs during recovery. This problem suggests a volatility increase 2024, perhaps as early as Q2.  Some markets are already seeing a slight increase in occupancy costs for the most desirable properties.\n\n\nReturn to work issues, including returning to a workplace office, still need to be settled, with a difficult-to-measure number of employees objecting to day-to-day office returns\n and many firms with an undetermined commitment to insisting on return.  Construction spending, which appears to be ticking up at the moment, is also uncertain, albeit highly likely as roads and bridges are seemingly not statistically assured, to be a high priority at the national and local state/city level.  Available construction labour before the pandemic was challenging for contractors – both domestic and foreign – and workplace departures in this cohort seem to have grown during the pandemic.\n\n\nIncentives for returning to the workplace across most categories\n and for entrants in the construction workforce are seemingly undeterminable now as the impact on potential inflation is being considered in both the private and public sectors.  The November 2024 election period is also a factor, as neither major party has the appetite to consider the possibility of inflationary pressures in an election year.\n\n\nThe US economy thrives during periods of optimism, and most forecasts are at least relatively optimistic given the period we have been through following the Covid pandemic\n and related illness issues.  As well, we have had quite a few departures from active full-time employment, and then we have the work-from-home phenomenon that has been and still is quite unsettled. . . We believe 2024, barring any unsettling events or natural catastrophes, to be a year of recovery.  Questions will still exist about workforce development, deployment and varied alternatives. It is not limited to working from home but includes other issues we hear of, including more offshoring.\n\n\nThe other significant risks we are considering are further conflicts\n amongst nations in the Middle East, the Baltics and Africa and new conflicts amongst other forces in various areas of the world.  Even slight mistakes can yield extended periods of negative impact for employers and employees.\n\n\nEUROPE:\n\n\nBELGIUM:\n\n\nEconomic growth in Belgium\n is expected to remain broadly stable over the forecast horizon, at 1.4% in 2023 and 2024 and 1.5% in 2025. Given the evolution of energy prices and the mitigating effect of government measures, inflation is projected to reach 2.4% in 2023 and 4.2% in 2024 before declining to 1.9% in 2025.\n\n\nPrivate consumption is set to remain robust over the forecast horizon\n, as the automatic indexation of wages and social benefits supports the purchasing power of households. Real GDP growth is expected to reach 1.4% in 2023 and then remain broadly stable in 2024 and 2025.\n\n\nSlowdown in employment: \nAfter reaching 2.1% in 2022, employment growth is forecast to slow down to 0.8% in 2023 and 0.6% in 2024. The unemployment rate is expected to remain at around 5.6% before declining to 5.4% in 2025. Following mainly the automatic indexation of wages, compensation of employees per head is set to grow by 7.0% in 2023, 3.6% in 2024 and 3.1% in 2025.\n\n\nBULGARIA:\n\n\nEconomic growth is expected to slow down in 2023 and 2024 \nand then recover in 2025. After a strong performance in 2022, exports are set to contract in 2023 due to subdued foreign demand and rebound afterwards. Imports are also expected to contract sizeably in 2023 after expanding strongly in 2022.\n\n\nHousehold consumption is projected to temporarily stagnate in late 2023 and early 2024\n and then resume a moderate expansion. Inflation is set to decelerate further, albeit at a slower pace. The government deficit is expected to increase slightly in 2023, driven by higher spending on increases in pensions and wages legislated in previous years.\n\n\nOverall, the labour market remains tight, with an unemployment rate of 4.5%\n in August 2023, but there are signs of exhaustion of further employment gains. The unemployment rate has increased by 0.5 pps. since the trough in January 2023, while new hires have dropped by 12% in the first seven months of 2023 compared to a year earlier.\n\n\nDENMARK:\n\n\nA Thriving Economic Landscape with Promising Market Niches for Businesses\n\n\nDenmark, a Nordic nation renowned for its progressive social policies, entrepreneurial spirit, and unwavering commitment to innovation, stands as a beacon of economic resilience amidst a global landscape of challenges. Its robust financial foundations, highly skilled workforce and steadfast dedication to technological advancement have propelled Denmark into a position of global prominence.\n\n\nGDP Expansion and Foreseeable Trends: \nDenmark's economic trajectory has demonstrated remarkable resilience, weathering the storms of the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, the country's GDP growth soared to a remarkable 3.8%, driven by a surge in domestic consumption and a robust export performance. While some economic headwinds may arise, experts project a continuation of moderate growth in the coming years, with estimates ranging from 1.3% to 1.9% for 2023 and 2024. This outlook is supported by recent developments, such as the Danish government's announcement of a EUR 1.5 billion package to help the economy and the country's strong performance in the financial sector.\n\n\nEmerging Market Sectors Poised for Prominence: \nDenmark's economic landscape is brimming with promising market segments poised for significant growth in the years to come. These industries are driven by technological advancements, shifting consumer preferences, and supportive government initiatives. Among the most prominent sectors are:\n\n\n\n\nSustainable Technology:\n Denmark's global leadership in sustainable energy solutions is expected to continue creating immense opportunities for businesses specialising in renewable energy technologies, energy efficiency solutions, and sustainable infrastructure development. The government's focus on green energy initiatives, such as expanding offshore wind power, will boost this sector further.\n\n\nDigital Health:\n The Danish healthcare sector is embracing digital innovations at an accelerating pace, generating strong demand for companies developing telemedicine solutions, data analytics tools, and personalised healthcare platforms. The recent launch of a national digital health strategy, which aims to improve access to healthcare and enhance patient outcomes, is expected to fuel growth in this sector.\n\n\nAdvanced Manufacturing:\n Denmark's manufacturing industry is renowned for its precision engineering, automation, and sustainability. Businesses that excel in these areas are attracting significant investment and capturing market share domestically and internationally. The Danish government is encouraging the modernisation of the manufacturing sector through initiatives such as developing \"superclusters\" that bring together companies and research institutions to collaborate on innovation.\n\n\nE-commerce and Logistics:\n As the global e-commerce market expands, the need for efficient e-commerce platforms and logistics solutions is rising. Businesses that can provide seamless and cost-effective fulfilment services are poised for significant growth. The Danish government's support for digital infrastructure and logistics capabilities is expected to support this sector's development further.\n\n\n\n\nDiverse Business Opportunities Across Various Industries: \nBeyond these emerging sectors, Denmark offers a plethora of business opportunities across various industries:\n\n\n\n\nLife Sciences: Denmark's pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is flourishing, driven by a solid research base and a supportive regulatory environment. Companies in this sector are well-positioned to capitalise on global demand for innovative healthcare solutions. The Danish government's investments in research and development in the life sciences sector are expected to contribute to further growth.\n\n\nAgTech: Denmark's leadership in agricultural exports is complemented by a rapidly evolving agricultural technology sector. Companies developing innovative precision farming solutions, sustainable agriculture practices, and food safety technologies hold immense potential. The Danish government's focus on improving agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability will likely support this sector's growth.\n\n\nFinTech: Denmark's financial sector embraces digital transformation, providing a fertile ground for FinTech companies to innovate and disrupt traditional financial services. Opportunities exist in payment solutions, digital banking, and financial data analytics. The Danish government's support for FinTech initiatives, such as creating a FinTech sandbox, is expected to foster innovation and growth in this sector.\n\n\nCreative Industries: Denmark is an innovative hub with strengths in design, architecture, and media. Businesses harnessing these talents for branding, marketing, and digital content creation are gaining traction in domestic and international markets. The Danish government's promotion of design and creativity is expected to continue to support this sector's growth.\n\n\n\n\nFINLAND:\n\n\nBank of Finland’s interim forecast: economic recovery will be delayed.\n\n\nThe Finnish economy is in mild recession in 2023, according to the Bank of Finland’s interim forecast published today. The rise in prices, interest rates, and weaker export demand are weighing on the economy. The favourable trend in employment will come to a halt, but domestic inflation is now slowing rapidly. However, the economic recovery will take longer than previously estimated. The downside risks to economic growth have increased.\n\n\n“The recession is still expected to be shallow, but the economy will recover more slowly than estimated in the summer. Statistical data available in the summer indicate weak developments for the rest of the year. In addition, risks in the domestic and global economy have grown,” says Bank of Finland Head of Forecasting Meri Obstbaum.\n\n\nAccording to the Bank of Finland’s September 2023 interim forecast, GDP will contract by 0.2% in 2023. The economy will slowly start to recover from the recession in 2024. GDP growth in 2024 will be slower than projected in the Bank of Finland’s June forecast, i.e. only 0.2%. In 2025, economic growth will gather pace, albeit only to 1.4%.\n\n\nI\nNFLATION WILL SLOW SIGNIFICANTLY – EMPLOYMENT RATE WILL DIP: \nEmployment has been growing for a long time, but it will dip during the recession. The employment rate for the 20 to 64 age group will fall to 77.7% in 2024. The number of persons employed will resume growth in 2025 as economic growth strengthens, and the employment rate will return close to the level in 2022. Higher prices are eroding households’ purchasing power, but growth in earnings and falling inflation are improving their consumption opportunities. Inflation will slow to 1% in 2024, but services prices will continue to rise faster than previously expected.\n\n\nThe risks surrounding the forecast are predominantly on the downside.\n Geopolitical confrontations and the transmission of the rise in interest rates to the economy may lead to adverse developments. Slower-than-expected growth in the global economy would further decrease Finnish companies’ opportunities for increasing exports. Higher interest rates also curb investment and affect real estate market activity. In Finland, the outlook for residential construction has weakened rapidly due to the housing market freeze, and difficulties in the sector may come to a head and affect employment and the economy more strongly than projected.\n\n\nSources include Bank of Finland\n\n\nFRANCE:\n\n\nBanque de France assesses that the French economy will gradually emerge from inflation without a recession. In the short term, the latest information available suggests a slight downward revision of growth for 2023 to 0.8%. However, Banque de France is maintaining its growth projections for 2024 (0.9%) and 2025 (1.3%) unchanged and is expecting growth of 1.6% in 2026. This acceleration in 2026 assumes that the effects of recent shocks to the French economy (external tax shock, tightening of monetary and financial conditions) will have abated by that time.\n\n\nEconomic activity\n is expected to remain sluggish in 2024 before strengthening subsequently. In 2024, growth should be driven to a greater extent by household consumption due to the fall in inflation, which will benefit the purchasing power of wages and the lower saving ratio.\n\n\nHeadline inflation \n(HICP), which peaked in early 2023, is expected to continue to subside: after averaging 5.7% in 2023, inflation should fall sharply to 2.5% in 2024. This projection has been revised slightly downwards compared with the September forecast. Headline inflation should decline substantially over the forecast horizon, helped by falling energy prices; core inflation (i.e. HICP excluding energy and food) should also come down, albeit more slowly.\n\n\nThe turnaround that Banque de France forecasts in the labour market now appears to be underway. Following a time lag over the next few quarters, employment is expected to adjust to the economic slowdown observed since late 2022, with only a partial recovery of past productivity losses. Consequently, the unemployment rate should continue to rise, although it should stay under 8% in 2025, before resuming a downward trajectory as economic activity recover.\n\n\nSources include: Banque de France - Macroeconomic projections\n\n\nGERMANY:\n\n\nGlobal challenges and crises will again influence economic expectations for Germany in 2024. The impact of the government's decisions is more massive than recently. Among others, these support climate protection, energy transformation through decarbonisation and nuclear phase-out, and many funding programs, particularly of a social nature.\n\n\nGermany is one of the largest economies in the world\n. The government is pursuing an austerity course on the one hand and significant changes in the population's behaviour on the other. We shall see to what extent this will be successful. The Constitutional Court recently overturned the government's debt and financing dreams. - The economy needs reliability for investment and the immigration of skilled workers. At present, migration is taking place in the social systems.\n\n\nGlobal trade restrictions have recently hit Germany particularly hard.\n After a recession of -0.1% GDP in 2023, the Bundesbank is forecasting growth of +0.4% GDP for 2024, with inflation set to fall to 2.7%. Other forecasts by economic institutes and chambers of commerce generally put growth at around +1.0%, with a range of -0.5% or +1.3% and inflation well below 3%. - To finance the energy transformation, the country needs investments and an inflow of capital of more than EUR 100 billion per year over many years, which has yet to be realised in recent years, on the contrary.\n\n\nIn the individual sectors, expectations for 2024 are somewhat differentiated;\n the sentiment is poor, worse than the situation. Restructuring, strategy renewal and transformation are the growth drivers. Despite rising wages, consumption could grow only slightly, but, e.g., domestic, and international vacation travel should be booming. Employment levels remain high. There will be downward corrections, including in real estate prices. However, there is a shortage of residential units, and fewer are being built due to higher production and financing costs and many regulations.\n\n\nHigher financing costs have also meant risks for SMEs recently and can lead to restructuring and\n risks for the financial market. - In summary, growth should occur in services and production, but most sectors are complaining about a lack of predictability. Ultimately, export growth could be even more robust and essentially be the economy's engine in 2024.\n\n\nLUXEMBOURG:\n\n\nReal GDP growth is projected to fall by 0.6% in 2023\n before recovering to 1.4% in 2024 and 2.0% in 2025. The below-average growth in 2023 is mainly due to weak investment linked to tighter financing conditions and lower net exports, while their rebound explains the improvement in 2024.\n\n\nMirroring the decline in economic activity in 2023\n, the labour market is expected to weaken. Employment growth is projected to slow from 3.4% in 2022 to 1.7% in 2023 and 1.2% in 2024 before recovering to 1.5% in 2025. Unemployment dropped to 4.6% in 2022 but is expected to increase to 5.5% in 2023, 5.9% in 2024 and 6.0% in 2025.\n\n\nNETHERLANDS:\n\n\nFor 2023, the economy is expected to have grown by 0.1%\n compared to 2022. The Netherlands is expected to have modest growth for 2024 and 2025: 0.5% in 2024, followed by a further increase in economic growth to 1.0% in 2025.\n\n\nRetail inflation is expected to average 5.2% in the first half of 2024 before easing to its 4% target between July and \nSeptember and rising to 4.7% in the final quarter. However, the labour market remains strong, with the unemployment rate still at a historically low level and with significant increases in wage growth. The pickup in wage growth is projected to lead to a recovery in real wages and a return to modest private consumption growth towards the end of 2023. Overall, GDP growth in 2023 is expected at 0.6%.\n\n\nThe Dutch labour market continues to be tight\n, with vacancies exceeding the number of unemployed persons and several sectors experiencing labour shortages. The unemployment rate grew marginally to 3.5% in the second quarter of 2023 while remaining historically low. On the back of a slowing economy, the unemployment rate is forecast to increase to 3.9% in 2024 and 2025 yet remaining well below the unemployment rates seen before the pandemic. Fuelled by a tight labour market and surging inflation, nominal wage growth increased considerably and is expected to reach 6.2% in 2023, 5.5% in 2024 and 3.9% in 2025.\n\n\nNORWAY:\n\n\nInterest rate (national bank forecast)\n as of January 2023 was 1.75 % but increased over the year to end on 31st December at 4,00%. Inflation is high at 4.80%, and the unemployment rate stands at 3.2 %\n\n\nTotal Exports were € 241 090 000 000, mainly from oil and gas, and total imports were € 93 000 000 000; m\najor trading partners are Sweden, China, Germany, USA, Denmark, and the United Kingdom.\n\n\nNorway’s Major Industries include\n Oil & Gas, Fish and seafood and technology; expected forward (Norwegian Government) GNP in 2024 + 2.2%, GNP in 2025 + 1.8%GNP in 2024 2.6%.\n\n\nUnemployment is forecast in 2024 to be 3.9%\n and rise in 2025 at 4.1%; the interest rate (national) at the end of 2024 will peak at 3.25% and forecast at the end of 2025 to be around 2.75%.\n\n\nSPAIN:\n\n\nOCDE upwards revisions for the Spanish economy: \nFor 2023, the institution will raise by four-tenths to 2.1% of the Spanish Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth compared to its last forecasts in March. For 2024, the OCDE has also improved its economic expectations by 0.2% compared to the March estimates, reaching 1.9% for the coming year.\n\n\nThe data provided by the OCDE for this year aligns with the government's growth expectations, which stated that Spain would grow by 2.1% in 2023. However, for 2024, the OCDE differs from the government, which claimed that the GDP would increase by 2.4%.\n\n\nThe OCDE indicates that the increase in external demand will boost exports, encouraging private investment despite financing costs. However, the observatory also points out risks: a possible escalation of the war and increased financial vulnerability due to tightening lending conditions caused by interest rate hikes.\n\n\nThe observatory of industrialised countries\n indicates that Spain will end 2024 with a general Consumer Price Index (CPI) of 3.9% due to the fall in energy prices and the tightening of monetary policy.\n\n\nImprovement in financial conditions & economic boost above the Eurozone: \nThe OCDE expects fiscal conditions to improve in the coming months because the withdrawal of assistance will make fiscal policy \"slightly restrictive\" in the next two years, leading to a decrease in the public deficit from 3.5% in 2023 to 3.2% in 2024. The government and the Commission assessed that Spain would reach the deficit target of 3% by 2024.\n\n\nThe estimated growth of the Spanish economy is double that of the Eurozone\n, which will expand its GDP by a modest 0.9% in 2023 and increase it to 1.5% in 2024. Germany, the European locomotive, is undergoing a downward revision, and the OCDE expects its economy to stagnate this year. However, it will return to growth in 2024 with a rise of 1.3%.\n\n\nSpain's position has been relatively better than that of other Northern European countries, with inflation reaching 3.2% in May and less energy dependence on the Russian market.\n\n\nSWEDEN:\n\n\nBeginning in 2024, the Swedish economy is set to grow again\n, albeit slowly. However, the labour market is expected to weaken, with unemployment reaching 8.5 per cent next year. Inflation is decreasing and will be below Riksbank's inflation target by the second half of 2024. Consequently, the Riksbank will initiate a series of interest rate cuts next summer, as indicated in the latest forecast.\n\n\nThe weak demand is evident in the decline in employment seen during the past autumn\n, and the labour market is projected to weaken further. Unemployment will continue to rise, peaking at 8.5 per cent by the end of 2024. The downturn in the labour market will not be as severe as in previous recessions, as companies are, to an extent, retaining staff to meet demand when the economic situation improves.\n\n\nCPIF inflation dropped from over 10 per cent last year to 3.6 per cent in November 2023, \nprimarily due to lower energy and international commodity prices. Highly leveraged households were susceptible to higher interest and rising inflation because of the quick changes in interest rates on their accumulated debt, in line with higher policy rates. Relatively tight financial conditions will continue restraining domestic demand over the forecast horizon. In 2024, private consumption is projected to be held back by uncertainty.\n\n\nUK:\n\n\nThe UK economy performed better than expected in 2023: \nAt the start of 2023, the market consensus was that GDP would fall by 1%. Economists are now forecasting growth of 0.5%. \n\n\nOn a year-to-date basis, business investment grew by 6.3% in Q3 2023. Household consumption – the main growth engine in regular times – was up by 0.3%, but it’s still below its pre-pandemic level. That’s essentially a result of successive adverse shocks to real incomes.\n\n\nModest GDP growth of 0.5% in 2024\n: GDP is anticipated to grow at a modest pace of 0.5% in 2024 and only to pick up towards its steady-state rate of around 1% in 2025.\n\n\nThe unemployment rate remains at 4% \nor above in sectors such as hospitality and healthcare, while nominal pay growth was close to 8% in September. The UK has seen a slight job slowdown but remains high at around 900,000 open roles.\n\n\nThe next UK general election will likely be held in the second half of 2024, \nor it could be pushed to January 2025. Given that the Labour Party has consistently held a double-digit lead in the polls, it is anticipated there will be a change of government. However, the Labour Party has stressed that economic growth will be at the heart of their government in the first few years in office, which should give investors confidence rather than uncertainty.\n\n\nThe UK service sector has traditionally been the key to UK economic growth. This sector held up well in the past year and is anticipated to grow in 2024 with professional services and equities. The stock market is growing, and\n the hospitality sector will largely be flatlining. The manufacturing sector will benefit from reducing inflation and lower interest rates, meaning they can borrow less to invest than they have in the preceding two years. However, this is expected in the second half of 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (5691)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

We all know that one needs a professional sherpa who can guide you through the complex terrain, uncertain weather, and twists and turns of Everest. \n\n\nNow, as an organization, you need to understand that an executive search firm is your sherpa in navigating specialized recruitments. Unlike age-old methods of recruitment, an industrial professional recruitment firm goes beyond just matching the CVs to job descriptions. They assess, identify, and employ a proactive approach to secure the best talent in the industry for your organization.\n\n\nUnderstanding Executive Search Firm\n\n\nExecutive search firms, also known as headhunters, are professional recruitment agencies that specialize in identifying and placing exclusive upper-level management positions and senior leadership, executive, and board member roles at companies.\n\n\nThe search firm uses its extensive network and industry connections to source potential candidates who have the requisite skills, experiences, and competencies to meet the role requirements. This involves identifying employed or passive candidates who may not be actively job searching but could be a good fit and open to new opportunities.\n\n\nThe \nglobal executive search consultants firm\n manages the entire life cycle of the search, from assessing the organizational key preferences to recruiting, screening, and finally on boarding the senior leadership.\n\n\nHow Executive Search Firm Works?\n\n\nHere is the step-by-step guide to how an executive search firm works:\n\n\nStep 1: Client Briefing and Needs Assessment\n\n\nThis phase involves you partnering with the executive search firm to clearly define the administrative role, ideal candidate profile, must-have competencies, and search criteria. The search consultant will ask probing questions to fully understand your company, culture, and specific leadership needs.\n\n\nStep 2: Develop a detailed candidate profile\n\n\nHere, the search firm synthesizes insights from your briefing to compile a comprehensive depiction of the precise experiences, skill sets, qualifications, leadership style, motivators, and personality fit required to excel in the executive position at your organization. This candidate profile guides identification and assessment.\n\n\nStep 3: Research and candidate identification\n\n\nThe executive search consultants tap into their extensive networks, databases, and connections to pinpoint individuals who align with the defined candidate profile. They will likely contact several qualified employed or passive candidates to gauge interest and fit.\n\n\nStep 4: Candidate evaluation and interviews\n\n\nIn the candidate evaluation and interviews step, the most promising candidates are thoroughly vetted through preliminary interviews, assessments, and verification to determine who merits consideration for final round interviews. The search firm pre-screens candidates to ensure those presented to you are worth your time and meet defined criteria.\n\n\nStep 5: Negotiation and offer presentation\n\n\nAfter final interviews, the executive search professional supports negotiation and offers a presentation to secure the chosen executive by representing your organization positively and highlighting the upside of joining your leadership team.\n\n\nStep 6: Onboarding support\n\n\nExecutive search firms also provide onboarding support and coaching during the transition and first months of the new executive's tenure to promote longer-term success. Their involvement can make landing an exceptional leader and ensure an effective leadership transition completely turnkey!\n\n\nBenefits of Using a Human Capital Search Firm\n\n\nAn organization may not feel the need for a \nhuman capital search\n firm, but here are the benefits one must not forget:\n\n\nAccess to a Wider Pool of Talent (Including Passive Candidates)\n\n\nExecutive search firms maintain large databases of leadership talent and extensive professional networks. This grants clients access to a broad spectrum of potential candidates suited to administrative roles, including top performers who may not actively be job hunting but are open to new opportunities. Search consultants identify and approach qualified leaders who can immediately fill critical openings.\n\n\nExpertise in Evaluating Leadership\n\n\nSeasoned executive search consultants possess specialized expertise in assessing leadership competencies and determining whether candidates' styles, motivations, and personalities align with the client's organizational culture and team dynamics. Their perceptive evaluation of management potential and cultural fit helps clients secure exceptional executives who will thrive.\n\n\nTime-Saving and Efficient Process\n\n\nThe executive talent search process is highly labor and time-intensive if done in-house. Outsourcing to an executive search firm allows internal talent acquisition leaders to invest energies into other critical HR priorities. In contrast, the search firm handles the entire process, presenting only thoroughly vetted candidates.\n\n\nReduced Risk of Bad Hires\n\n\nMaking a mistake in an executive leadership hire can detrimentally impact a company's performance and bottom line for years. Executive search firms vet candidates extensively to minimize hiring risk. Their support results in landing exemplary leaders who drive growth, innovation, and financial returns - providing excellent ROI.\n\n\nConfidentiality and Discretion\n\n\nThe executive search process necessitates utmost privacy, allowing employed candidates to explore new roles discreetly without jeopardizing current jobs while a search is ongoing. Search firms enable this by keeping clients' specific needs and targeted candidates' information entirely confidential through the completion of the search.\n\n\nWrapping Up\n\n\nExecutive talent management is crucial for organizational excellence and success. Finding the right leaders to enhance performance requires immense strategic forethought concerning ideal cultural matches, along with extensive networking to access exclusive executive candidate pools. \n\n\nExecutive search firm offers \nindustrial professional recruitment\n and focuses on understanding organizational and senior leadership demands. Executive search consultants are indispensable partners that are worthy of investment when acquiring exemplary leadership talent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3567)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

However, the global skills gap makes sourcing ideal C-suite executives who align with organizational capabilities and culture a considerable challenge.\n\n\nThis gives birth to the need for an \nexecutive search management consulting\n firm to cut through the complexities of hiring for leadership roles and minimize the lengthy hiring lag times to help companies excel. \n\n\nThis article sheds light on the importance of executive search firms in finding and sourcing top-level talents globally.\n\n\nThe Value Executive Search Management Consulting Firm Delivers\n\n\nAs organizations get ready to build exceptional leadership teams that drive strategic growth in an era of unprecedented change, joining hands with specialists in executive search proves invaluable. An executive search firm offers human capital services beyond traditional recruitment methods. \n\n\nExtensive Networks and Deep Industry Knowledge\n\n\nExecutive search professionals maintain consistent engagement, allowing access to 75% of candidates who remain passive but open to compelling opportunities. Additionally, executive firms dedicate in-house research capabilities to comprehensively profile organizational needs, direction, and culture.\n\n\nThey use these insights to pinpoint where desired leadership attributes and contributions align the best. These executive search firms don’t do generalized mass job listings and focus on customized top-level hiring. They combine external intelligence with internal strategies for optimized talent-company fit.\n\n\nComprehensive Candidate Assessment\n\n\nWhile resumes indicate career progressions, executive search consultants probe deeper using case interviews, personality evaluations, capability benchmarking against global standards, reference checks, and more tools during selection. \n\n\nThis rigorous methodology ensures companies receive detailed assessments of what a candidate has done and their problem-solving abilities, leadership traits, motivations, and other indicators of future impact. Rather than guessing at potential, specialized testing allows executive teams to onboard senior hires confidently with total transparency on proficiencies.\n\n\nThe executive search firms also offer \ninterim management services\n to their partner organizations during management transitions.\n\n\nTime-Saving and Efficient Process\n\n\nPursuing senior appointments demands substantial internal effort across networking, referrals, screening, interviewing, and assessing multiple prospects simultaneously. Employing a committed executive recruitment partner alleviates this burden through dedicated account management.\n\n\nFirms readily tap contacts and source leads matching specified attributes and qualify at scale faster. This shrinks executive vacancies that cost organizations crucial momentum. The efficiency also minimizes distraction, allowing existing leadership to focus on driving the enterprise.\n\n\nConfidentiality and Discretion\n\n\nFor publicly traded entities mainly, confidentiality represents an executive search advantage. Revealing high-level departures or appointments prematurely risks stability. Specialist recruiters operate discretely to avoid tipping news of C-suite movements, protect corporate reputation/share price, and keep competitive intelligence private during transitions.\n\n\nOnce hired, passive candidates also appreciate minimal exposure, guarding their current job status during their notice period. Executive firms that offer \nhuman capital services \nalso\n \nfollow best practices for access security and encrypted communication channels.\n\n\nNegotiation Expertise\n\n\nSuccessful leadership acquisition further requires astute salary and benefits negotiation. Beyond base pay, adequate equity compensation, bonuses, relocation terms, and other complex considerations, this field sees frequent change.\n\n\nStaff recruiters often lack the context or bandwidth to negotiate or sell total rewards optimally. Executive teams alternatively influence, motivate, and handle counteroffers through seasoned consultative selling and relationship-nurturing skills. Their outside standpoint helps secure win-win executive packages while promoting attraction.\n\n\nAlleviate Hiring Risks\n\n\nExecutive roles disproportionately influence the strategic trajectory, financial performance, and culture tone across large and small enterprises. Therefore, making misjudgments during critical leadership acquisitions can severely inhibit success. Business leaders cite regrettable executive appointments as one of the costliest mistakes.\n\n\nSpecialist executive search firms greatly minimize regrettable hiring risks by ensuring comprehensive due diligence. Their multi-layered assessment provides decision-makers valuable foresight into leadership style fit, competency proficiency, and likely impact that guards against instability from poor selections. Additional background verification also prevents scenarios of false credentials eroding team confidence.\n\n\nRemember: Organizations going through leadership transitions should consider interim management services for emergencies and temporary hirings.\n\n\nSecure Ideal Leadership Talent\n\n\nIn organizations competing fiercely on innovation, hiring a senior-level talent that differentiates is crucial yet tremendously tricky, especially with under 75% passive talents.\n\n\nExecutive search consultants circumvent this barrier through curated industry networking nurtured over years that solicits interest from satisfied top performers open to the proper leadership role. Proprietary access to elite circles allows custom-tailoring recruitment efforts centered on personality, working styles, and competencies that existing hiring channels cannot replicate quickly and precisely when vying for premier talent.\n\n\nHere’s How Taplow Can Help You\n\n\nWith extensive executive search experience across Europe, Asia Pacific, and the Americas spanning 22 years, the Taplow Group understands firsthand how to assess organizational needs strategically.

    "content": "2024 Work Trends: 5 Key Predictions by World-of-Work Expert\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nMonday, February 12, 2024\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe global workforce has enormous potential in the future, but are business leaders ready for the inevitable transformations that lie ahead? \n\n\nLeaders still trying to escape the transformations and challenges should acknowledge that - The future is already here. Our mind says these five predictions are here to change how this world works.\n\n\nTop 5 Key Predictions by World-of-Work Expert\n\n\nPost Covid, the world of work is not the same anymore. Here are the top trends to look forward to in 2024:\n\n\nGrowth of Remote and Hybrid Roles\n\n\nAfter Covid-19 hit the world, workplaces globally moved to remote or hybrid modes. But, even after the world is out of that home cage, organizations globally are ready for remote and hybrid roles. \n\n\nOrganizations can expect that 60–70% of positions will enjoy permanent remote possibilities and that hybrid workweeks will become more popular as employees look for the desired work-life balance. It is no surprise to say that remote & hybrid productivity will surpass because of the distributed teams, process standardization, virtual collaboration tools, and decentralized work software advances.\n\n\nDemand for Digital Fluency & Tech Skills\n\n\nAs the king of the 21st century is technology, organizations will see a rise in demand for digital fluency & technological skills like - machine learning, data analytics, automation system design, and augmented reality.\n\n\nEmployees should constantly upskill, and organizations should be looking out for talents with these sought-after skills. Mastering tech tools specific to your field, understanding data analysis, and adapting to AI workflows will be crucial for career success.\n\n\nThe Automation & AI Boom\n\n\nOrganizations are walking the pace of automation and AI and are ready to automate repetitive tasks and extract the hidden potential of humans for difficult problem-solving, creativity, and innovation.\n\n\nAI and robotics now reshape every job to automate grunt work and augment human strengths - changing standard tasks while raising output quality, insights, and innovation ability thanks to emerging symbiotic human-machine partnerships.\n\n\nContinuous Reskilling Needs\n\n\nWith automation and AI multiplying, there’s a massive need for re-training every 2-3 years in many fields thanks to fast-changing skill demands. Expect curriculum emphasis to shift from job-specific technical talents to transferable abilities like analytical thinking, creative problem-solving, empathy, adaptability, and lifelong learning in education systems.\n\n\nFlexible Schedules & Workflows\n\n\nOrganizations are eyeing output instead of routinized 9-to-5 office work weeks. Companies are ready to offer flexible workflows customized to employee schedules, which will allow them for remote work, compressed hours, job shares, evening shifts, or other options balancing personal needs, productivity, and balanced work life. \n\n\nThe transformation has already started. As you can see,e the global meetings are adjusted to a round-the-clock collaborative tone. Support structures for effective flexibility management become essential for leaders.\n\n\nWrapping Up\n\n\nEven if the changes are significant, they offer more inclusive, human-centered, and sustainable work environments in the future, where organizational objectives and employee well-being coexist. \n\n\nOrganizations that are courageous enough to influence the evolution of work rather than just react to it will benefit the most from taking strategic action today. Organizations must consider reskilling employees, modernizing tech platforms, streamlining their processes to promote work flexibility, and updating outdated rules.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2138)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "What is Coffee Badging and How to Deal with It as an Employer?\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nThursday, February 1, 2024\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the global pandemic, companies had no choice but to have their employees workinging from home. As restrictions eased, and companies asked their teams to return and work in a hybrid mode, a new trend sparked - Coffee Badging. \n\n\nSuch workers spend one or two hours in the office, have a cup of coffee, have warm talks with their colleagues over this coffee, and depart. A study by Owl Labs reveals that about 58% of hybrid workers have confessed to Coffee Badging.\n\n\nWhat is Coffee Badging?\n\n\nSimply put, coffee badging is not just about skipping work; it's about checking the \"office presence\" box without actually doing the work. Is it all about the new workplace fashion? Or is there something wrong with policies, fixed schedules, or maybe lousy micromanagement? Before we leap for \"HOW,\" we need our 'WHY.' So, let's understand the \"Why.\"\n\n\nWe are highlighting the potential origins of Coffee Badging and why it should be happening. On the one hand, employees deny themselves flexibility and work-life balance; they yearn for it. Second, it could be that they are in the stage where they believe that they have been undervalued or overmanaged.\n\n\nHowever, what can an employer do to correct this? We have provided steps below which can be followed by employers to embrace these trends.\n\n\nKey ways employers deal with Coffee Badging: \n\n\nThere's nothing in this world that cannot be solved with focus and inclusion; here are some of key points through which an employer can deal with Coffee Badging:\n\n\nPrioritize trust and autonomy:\n\n\n\n\nHybrid Culture:\n Free your team from their cubicles! Provide mixed schedules and remote-first options, allowing employees to work where they are most effective. Always keep in mind that a happy team fosters an efficient work environment.\n\n\nMeasure output, not hours:\n Ditch the presenteeism scorecard! Measure output, not office hours. Measure objectives, have high expectations, and allow creativity to come from wherever the signal is good.\n\n\nTransparent Communication:\n Encourage open discussions, frequent follow-ups, and honest decision-making. Create a culture in which feedback is free-flowing coffee, providing trust and teamwork.\n\n\n\n\nEmbrace underlying concerns:\n\n\n\n\nConduct Surveys:\n Reveal the real motivations behind the coffee badge shield! Conduct surveys, host open discussions, and listen to the needs of your workers. Do they crave flexible schedules? Is the office atmosphere more dead than yesterday's coffee grounds? Reveal the discontent to brew for solutions.\n\n\nCultural Hub:\n Reimagine your office space! Raise it from a shabby beige cubicle enclave to a place of lively interaction. the right furniture, bright spaces, and comfortable areas where people can have impromptu brainstorming sessions. The office should be a place people enjoy being in rather than avoid.\n\n\nReassess Metrics:\n Revise your performance metrics and communication strategies. Are they outdated and micromanaging? Align them with your new vision, which centers on outcomes and clearly defined goals.\n\n\n\n\nExplore alternative solutions:\n\n\n\n\nImplement Core Hours:\n Implement \"core hours\" for selected days when the in-person collaboration is at its peak. Bounce ideas off whiteboard lattes, plan during lunch hours, and promote teamwork without desk drudgery.\n\n\nInvest in Tech:\n Invest in high-quality communication tools, video conferencing applications, and project management software. Make remote collaboration easy, overcome physical boundaries, and create lively, productive virtual spheres.\n\n\nOffer Perks:\n Frame benefits and incentives that attract employees to use the office without compelling them to do so. Providing on-site fitness classes, catered lunches, or even a gourmet coffee bar will make your office inviting.\n\n\n\n\nWrapping Up:\n\n\nEmployers need to understand that coffee badging isn't just about a quick conversation; it is a symptom of a deeper thirst for trust, flexibility, and a productive work culture. We hope that this article sparks internal debate in your company to look at this emerging trend in the workplace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2161)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

A CEO should be able to balance risks and align them with the overall success parameters for the organization.

The modern day widely popular definition of emotional intelligence is one’s ability to recognize, use and handle their emotions in a manner that is beneficial to them both professionally and personally. As per Harvard Business Review, emotional intelligence comprises of factors such as social skills, empathy, self awareness and regulation, and motivation.\n\n\nHaving a deep understanding of these emotions equips individuals to harness and maintain better, more meaningful relationships both in and outside the workplace. It helps them stay constantly motivated and achieve higher targets, be more driven towards their personal as well as professional goals, empathise with coworkers and their struggles, and eventually contributes to higher confidence in their authentic individuality.\n\n\nIt has been concluded in recent researches that high emotional intelligence doesn’t just contribute to personal growth, but also plays a vital role in the workplace. Individuals that are emotionally aware and capable of handling their emotions in a respectful manner make desirable employees for growing organizations. They are excellent at coping  with massive as\n \nwell as rapid changes, are quick to think on their feet, and can come up with quicker resolutions since they can recognise and separate emotions  from the decision making process. Such analytical thinking contributes very largely to human capital development as these talented pool of individuals have proven to be competent, knowledgeable, skilled and well informed about various advancements across the globe. Since they make such a valuable asset, their relationship with their employers is of great significance to the organizations’ growth. Companies are now hiring \nprofessional and IT executive search firms\n to maintain and constantly expand this pool.\n\n\nOrganizations are no longer hesitant in investing religiously in the development of human capital by focusing on the emotional intelligence attribute of its employees. Human capital development also helps these organizations make better use of individual talents at hand in a diverse and unique manner that proves to be fruitful in long term growth.\n\n\nEmotional intelligence is a contributing factor when it comes to recognising potential leaders and preparing them for their future. Nowadays, the hiring process differs largely from the traditional one and is focused on the importance of emotional intelligence. \nGlobal consumer sector executive search\n programs focus on hiring employees that can multitask and collaborate .

These firms are now navigating a complex and evolving environment that demands a reevaluation of their strategies and methodologies. One significant shift is the integration of data analytics and artificial intelligence into the talent acquisition process. \nTop executive search firms\n now harness advanced algorithms to analyze vast datasets, providing unparalleled insights into candidate suitability and organizational fit.\n\n\nFor example, AI-powered solutions streamline candidate screening by swiftly analyzing vast quantities of resumes, applications, and cover letters, minimizing both time and resource expenditure. This automation not only mitigates human biases but also identifies optimal candidates for specific roles, enabling hiring experts to focus on crucial aspects of the process. Additionally, automation and AI contribute to an improved candidate experience through prompt and personalized responses, reducing wait times and utilizing chatbots for efficient communication. Predictive analytics further refine candidate selection by evaluating past records and present performances, enhancing accuracy. Beyond individual hires, these technologies play a crucial role in refining overall hiring strategies, leveraging vast data sources to inform data-backed decisions, keeping these firms way ahead in the competitive talent acquisition landscape.\n\n\nFurthermore, digital technologies have expanded the global reach of these firms. Leveraging online platforms, these \nprofessional services firms\n can connect with a diverse array of candidates, breaking down geographical barriers and ensuring a more inclusive and comprehensive search process. This shift is instrumental in addressing the increasing demand for diverse leadership teams that bring varied perspectives and experiences.\n\n\nSocial media platforms and online professional networks have become instrumental tools for executive search firms. These platforms offer a dynamic space for talent identification, networking, and candidate assessments.

An influential online presence and positive digital reputation are paramount for attracting both clients and high-caliber executive talent. Social proof, testimonials, and a thought leadership presence contribute to building credibility and trust in the digital space. Additionally, the evolving expectations of both clients and candidates in the digital age necessitate a more transparent and personalized approach.

For asset management consultants, the ability to navigate and capitalize on market fluctuations is not just a skill but a critical aspect of delivering value to clients. In this blog post, we will delve into the strategies that asset management consultants can employ to steer their clients through turbulent market conditions, ensuring resilience and growth in the face of uncertainty.\n\n\nUnderstanding the Landscape\n\n\nMarket volatility can be triggered by various factors, including geopolitical events, economic indicators, and unexpected global crises. Asset management consultants must stay vigilant and continuously monitor these factors to anticipate potential market shifts. By maintaining a deep understanding of the current economic landscape, consultants can proactively position their clients' portfolios to weather storms and seize opportunities.\n\n\nDiversification and Risk Mitigation\n\n\nOne of the fundamental strategies for managing market volatility is diversification. Asset management consultants emphasize the importance of constructing well-diversified portfolios to spread risk across different asset classes. By allocating investments strategically, consultants can help clients minimize the impact of a downturn in any specific market segment, enhancing the overall stability of the portfolio.\n\n\nFurthermore, risk mitigation strategies play a crucial role. \nAsset management consultants \nactively assess the risk tolerance of their clients and adjust investment strategies accordingly. This might involve incorporating alternative investments, hedging strategies, or dynamically rebalancing portfolios to align with changing market conditions.\n\n\nActive Management and Tactical Adjustments\n\n\nIn times of heightened volatility, a proactive and hands-on approach to portfolio management becomes essential. Asset management consultants leverage their expertise to make tactical adjustments to investment portfolios. This may include shifting allocations based on emerging trends, exploiting market inefficiencies, or tactically rebalancing to capture short-term opportunities.\n\n\nTransparent Communication \n\n\nEffective communication is paramount during periods of market volatility. Asset management consultants not only implement strategies to protect and grow client portfolios but also play a vital role in managing client expectations. Clear and transparent communication about market conditions, the rationale behind investment decisions, and the potential impact on portfolios fosters trust and helps clients stay committed to their long-term financial goals.\n\n\nUtilizing Technology and Data Analytics\n\n\nModern asset management relies heavily on technology and data analytics. Asset management consultants leverage sophisticated tools and analytics to gain insights into market trends, identify potential risks, and optimize portfolio performance. By staying at the forefront of technological advancements, consultants can make informed decisions that align with their clients' financial objectives.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, we use diversification, risk mitigation, active management, clear communication, and the intelligent use of technology as key pillars that enable our consultants to guide our clients through turbulent market conditions. In doing so, we not only preserve and enhance the wealth of our clients but also reinforce our role as trusted financial advisors in an ever-changing financial landscape.\n\n\nTo know more about our services such as leadership coaching, professional recruitment, \nreal estate recruitment\n, and \nindustrial consultancy services\n, speak to our consultants or visit our website at \nwww.taplowgroup.com\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2450)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

If a leader senses a misalignment between their values and those of the organization, it can erode trust and engagement among team members, potentially impacting morale and productivity.\n\n\nEthical Misalignment\n\n\nLeaders often have a strong ethical compass, and when they perceive a disagreement between their personal ethics and the organization's practices or decisions, it can create internal tension. This might involve issues such as integrity, honesty, social responsibility, or fairness.\n\n\nImpact on Decision-Making\n\n\nValues play a crucial role in shaping decision-making processes. If a leader feels compelled to make decisions that go against their core values due to organizational expectations, it can lead to internal conflict and a sense of moral discomfort.\n\n\nIntegrity and Authenticity\n\n\nLeaders who prioritize integrity and authenticity may find it difficult to maintain these qualities when faced with a values conflict. Authentic leadership involves staying true to oneself, and leaders may step down to preserve their authenticity if they feel pressured to compromise it.\n\n\nLong-Term Satisfaction and Well-Being\n\n\nLeaders who compromise their values for an extended period may experience a decline in job satisfaction and overall well-being. This can lead to burnout, stress, and a sense of disillusionment, ultimately prompting them to consider leaving the organization.\n\n\nValues are a crucial component of organizational culture. Leaders who perceive a significant misfit between their personal values and the prevailing culture may decide to step down to seek an environment where their values are better aligned. In such situations, leaders may see resigning as a principled stand, choosing integrity over expediency. It's a recognition that personal values are non-negotiable and form the foundation of their leadership identity. This decision, while challenging, is often driven by a desire to remain true to oneself and to uphold a sense of moral and ethical responsibility in the face of conflicting organizational values.\n\n\nSpeak to our consultants today to assess your organizational culture and course correct if needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2448)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

This journey is not an easy one – understanding an organization’s culture, its people, and processes and then driving organizational change is a daunting task. This is where organizational consulting firms step in; the experts take control and ensure a smooth transition and organization-wide change with a focus on executive search and development of human capital.\n\n\nLet us navigate through the different aspects of organizational change and understand how these firms drive success.\n\n\nExecutive search with passive hiring\n\n\nA crucial aspect of organizational change is to bring in the right set of leaders. When times are difficult, you need the best captain to hold the helm and navigate through the tough waters. \nExecutive search firms\n are all about identifying the best talent for your organization. It is not only about those actively looking for a job but also about those who are exceptionally talented yet not looking for any jobs.

It is also about upskilling and training your existing workforce and empowering them to perform better. The process involves identifying gaps and evaluating the training and learning needs of the workforce. Again, this is not a one-size-fits-all solution; different employees or categories of employees would require different sets of training and skilling. This requires a deep understanding of the industry's best practices, benchmarks, and knowledge of competitors’ activities. It might look challenging; however, this is where executive search firms excel and deliver value to their clients.\n\n\nManaging multiple organizational transitions\n\n\nThere are many aspects of organizational change, like hiring top leaders, mergers and acquisitions, software modernization, and likewise. In each of these situations, it is important to ensure a smooth transition to the desired state. \nOrganizational consulting firms\n play a crucial role in ensuring this smooth transition by offering their consulting services. Change management is very difficult, involving effective communications, and managing employee expectations while ensuring no harm to the business deliverables.

Thus, once again, organizational change management firm wins the day for you.\n\n\nBy now you must have realized the pivotal role of these firms in bringing in transformational change. Be it through executive search and \nhuman capital development\n, these firms are the catalysts of transformation, shaping a successful tomorrow for your organization.

Apart from this appalling statistic, it can also be detrimental to employee productivity and morale.\n\n\nA toxic work culture often stems from ineffective leadership that lacks sound business strategy, capability development, and interpersonal skills. Watch out for these signs in your organization.\n\n\nIneffective communication within a workplace can lead to confusion and diminish employees' trust and confidence, contributing significantly to dissatisfaction. Non-inclusive practices, such as favoritism and exclusion from decision-making, create a sense of disconnection among employees, emphasizing the importance of fostering a fair and unbiased environment for rewards and recognition.\n\n\nThe impact of poor leadership on employee attrition is profound, as the saying goes, \"People don't leave their jobs; they leave their bosses.\" A lack of opportunities for professional growth, whether through skill advancement or mentorship, can demotivate employees. To counter this, organizations should invest in training and workshops to facilitate continuous learning and professional development.\n\n\nHigh attrition rates often result from employee unhappiness and a toxic workplace atmosphere. Establishing a healthy work-life balance is crucial, as a lack thereof contributes to emotional and physical burnout, creating a detrimental environment. Additionally, fair and unbiased performance management is essential to curb attrition, ensuring that employees feel valued and satisfied.\n\n\nEngagement issues arise when communication is unclear, and processes are inefficient. Surveys indicate that a significant percentage of employees feel disengaged due to these factors, highlighting the need for organizations to address communication gaps and streamline processes to enhance engagement and reduce job dissatisfaction and insecurity.\n\n\nTo drive your organization towards success, speak to our Human Capital Consultants today.

AI is not merely a technological evolution but a transformative force influencing the very fabric of organizational structures and processes.\n\n\nToday, AI is regarded as the catalyst for increased efficiency and productivity. Automation of routine tasks frees up human capital to focus on creative, strategic, and complex problem-solving endeavors. This shift in the division of labor fosters an environment where employees can leverage their unique cognitive abilities, driving innovation and pushing the boundaries of what is possible.\n\n\nOne significant aspect of AI in the workplace is its role in decision-making. AI algorithms, fueled by vast amounts of data, offer data-driven insights that assist leaders in making informed choices. This not only reduces the margin of error but also enhances the speed at which decisions can be made, crucial in the fast-paced business landscape.\n\n\nHowever, with the integration of AI, there comes a need for reskilling and upskilling the workforce. The nature of jobs is evolving, and individuals must adapt to working alongside intelligent machines. Companies that invest in employee training programs to harness the power of AI will find themselves better positioned to thrive in the future.\n\n\nThe ethical implications of AI also take center stage in the workplaces. As AI systems learn and adapt, issues of bias, transparency, and accountability arise. Striking a balance between the benefits of AI and the need for responsible and fair use becomes a critical consideration for organizations looking to create a workplace that prioritizes both technological advancement and ethical standards.\n\n\nEmbracing the transformative potential of AI while addressing the challenges it presents can be quite challenging. It requires a strategic approach to leverage AI for increased efficiency and innovation, coupled with a commitment to continuous learning, ethical considerations, and a people-centric focus that ensures the well-being and growth of the workforce amidst technological evolution.\n\n\nSpeak to our experts today to navigate this challenge successfully or visit www.taplowgroup.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2080)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Each choice comes with its own set of advantages and considerations. Here are the nuances that businesses must explore in both interim and permanent leadership and make the right decision for their unique needs.\n\n\nInterim executives bring a wealth of experience and specialized expertise, allowing companies to swiftly access leadership talent tailored to their specific needs. This agile approach is particularly advantageous during times of transition, crisis, or when undertaking strategic initiatives, enabling organizations to benefit from seasoned leaders without the long-term commitment. This approach not only enhances organizational resilience but also positions companies to navigate the complexities of the business landscape with agility and precision.\n\n\nFlexibility in Times of Change \nInterim leaders bring a level of flexibility that is invaluable during times of transition. Whether it's navigating a sudden departure or steering through a period of strategic change, interim executives provide a swift and adaptable solution.\n\n\nTargeted Expertise: \nOrganizations often turn to interim leaders to address specific challenges. These seasoned professionals bring a wealth of experience and expertise, providing targeted solutions without the long-term commitment.\n\n\nCost-Effective Solutions: \nExecutive Interim management\n can be a cost-effective strategy, especially for short-term projects or during periods of uncertainty. Companies can access high-caliber talent without the long-term financial commitment associated with permanent hires.\n\n\nObjectivity and Independence: \nInterim leaders, being temporary fixtures, can bring a fresh and objective perspective to organizational challenges. Their independence allows them to make tough decisions without being hindered by internal politics.\n\n\nOn the other hand, permanent hiring is a strategic investment in the enduring success and stability of an organization. It involves the selection of candidates for long-term employment, emphasizing a commitment to the company's vision and values. Permanent hires contribute to the cultivation of a consistent organizational culture, allowing them to become deeply integrated into the fabric of the company over time. This form of hiring is particularly instrumental in leadership roles where sustained leadership is critical for building relationships, fostering innovation, and steering the organization through long-term strategic initiatives. Beyond merely filling a role, permanent hiring is a testament to an organization's dedication to leadership development and the establishment of a robust talent pipeline, ensuring continuity and growth in the ever-evolving landscape of business.\n\n\nIn organizational leadership, the choice between interim and permanent leaders is a strategic move. It's not about choosing one over the other, but rather about finding the right balance based on the specific needs and challenges of your organization. Whether building a bridge to stability with interim leaders or cultivating long-term success with permanent executives, each choice contributes to the ever-evolving narrative of organizational excellence. The key lies in understanding your organization's unique journey and choosing the leadership solution that aligns with its aspirations and challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2631)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Building a strong board is imperative for any organization aiming for sustained success and strategic growth. Board search consultant firms play an important role in this process, bringing expertise, industry knowledge, and a well-established network to the table. Here are five ways in which board search firms contribute to the creation of a robust and effective board.\n\n\n1. Expert Identification of Top Talent\n\n\nThese firms help to identify and assess top talent for board positions. Their extensive networks and industry insights enable them to pinpoint individuals with the right mix of skills, experience, and cultural fit for a particular organization. This expertise ensures that the board is comprised of individuals who not only possess the necessary technical qualifications but also align with the company's values and strategic objectives.\n\n\n2. Market Intelligence for Informed Decisions\n\n\nStaying ahead of industry trends and market dynamics is crucial for building a board that can navigate challenges and capitalize on opportunities. \nBoard search consultant\n firms provide invaluable market intelligence, offering insights into emerging governance practices, regulatory changes, and industry trends.

Supervisors and employees who are skilled in conflict resolution and communication can benefit from a variety of factors, such as:\n\n\nBetter Relationships: Having open dialogue with colleagues and settling conflicts amicably can help to strengthen relationships. When people feel heard and understood, they are more likely to cooperate and trust one another. Increased Productivity: Resolving disagreements at work prevents them from getting worse and from wasting time and money. Staff members are therefore better able to focus on their tasks, which increases productivity.\n\n\nIncreased Job Satisfaction: A positive work environment with effective dispute resolution encourages increased job satisfaction. Employee satisfaction and engagement are higher when there is no unresolved conflict or unmet issues.\n\n\nOpen discussions can inspire creative ideas and novel solutions. Open communication of ideas among colleagues helps foster creativity and problem-solving skills.\n\n\nRetention: A congenial work environment with strong conflict resolution skills helps reduce employee turnover. A company that has employees who feel that their issues are recognised and addressed is more likely to keep them on board.\n\n\nCompany Reputation: Organisations with strong workplace cultures and effective dispute resolution techniques tend to draw in more prospective employees and clients.\n\n\nKnowing how to handle disagreement and tough talks at work facilitates problem-solving and the creation of a positive, productive work environment, which eventually helps both the individual employees and the business as a whole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2555)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Corporations worldwide are recognizing the inherent value of fostering a diverse and inclusive workforce, not only as a matter of ethics but also as a strategic advantage.\n\n\nAs CHROs across the landscape seek to find tools to advance their organization’s progress in the utilization of best practices to continue progress. Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its transformative capabilities, is poised to play a pivotal role in advancing DEI initiatives within corporations. Here we are seeking to explore how AI can facilitate the enhancement of diversity, equity, and inclusion in corporate settings.\n\n\nTalent Acquisition and Recruitment: \nOne of the most critical aspects of DEI in corporations is talent acquisition. AI can revolutionize recruitment processes by eliminating human biases. AI-driven recruitment tools can screen resumes, conduct initial interviews, and assess candidate suitability without regard to gender, ethnicity, or other personal characteristics. This not only has the potential to produce results in more equitable hiring but also broadens the talent pool by identifying exceptional candidates who may have been overlooked in traditional processes.\n\n\nInclusive Language and Content: \nBroadens the perspective of corporations to foster an inclusive environment through its natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. It can be programmed to identify and rectify biased or discriminatory language in corporate communications, thereby ensuring that internal and external content is inclusive and respectful. This contributes to the creation of an inclusive corporate culture.\n\n\nEnhanced Employee Training and Development: \nIdeally, when aligned with personalized learning platforms AI can cater to the individual needs of employees. These platforms can identify knowledge gaps and recommend training programs based on the employee’s career aspirations and strengths, ensuring equitable access to growth opportunities. Moreover, can provide accessibility features for differently abled employees, such as generating transcriptions for video content or suggesting alternative learning methods.\n\n\nPredictive Analytics for Retention: \nOne of the most significant potential outcomes is found in being a valuable tool in predicting factors that lead to employee turnover. By analyzing historical data, patterns can identified that are indicative of dissatisfaction or discrimination. HR departments can use this insight to proactively address issues and create more productive onboarding systems that lead to a more inclusive workplace. Furthermore, AI-driven surveys and sentiment analysis tools can help in collecting anonymous feedback, giving employees a safe space to voice their concerns.\n\n\nPay Equity and Compensation: \nIn corporations that are already collecting and analyzing compensation data. AI Tools can be used to cost effectively analyze the data and identify disparities based on gender, race, or other factors. By flagging such disparities, corporations can implement corrective actions to overtime rectify them, ensuring that all employees are compensated fairly for their work, thereby promoting equity. assist in maintaining pay equity within an organization.\n\n\nBias Mitigation: \nThe most optimistic outcome would be when designed and trained carefully, AI can aid in reducing biases in decision-making processes. For example, AI algorithms, when universally accepted as a performance evaluation tool, be used to mitigate bias in performance evaluations by focusing solely on objective, data-driven criteria. This ensures that promotion and rewards are granted fairly, without any implicit prejudice.\n\n\nChallenges and Considerations: \nWhile AI holds has the potential to be a considerable to for CHRO’s across the globe in advancing DEI initiatives, there are also challenges to consider. The following only represents some of these challenges to AI being the Silver Bullet to solving the myriad of DEI obstacles:\n\n\nData Bias:\n Like all data driven tools AI systems are only as good as the data they are trained on. If the training data is biased, the AI system can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing biases. Ethical Concerns: The use of AI in HR and DEI initiatives raises ethical questions about employee privacy and consent. It’s crucial to ensure that AI is used in ways that respect these concerns.\n\n\nHuman Oversight:\n AI should complement human decision-making, not replace it entirely. There should always be a human in the loop to oversee AI-driven processes. As such each of our individual biases and will always factor into the decision and implementation process for good and bad.\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence is a potent tool for advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in corporations but just a tool in the larger CHRO’s toolbox. The potent tool will require a greater understanding of its potential impact on advancing DEI across the corporate landscape. By addressing inherent human biases and automating processes that can be made more equitable, AI can help create a more inclusive workplace. \n\n\nHowever, it’s important to be mindful of potential landmines and ensure that AI is implemented with transparency, ethics, and a commitment to the overarching goal of fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion in corporate environments. With the right approach, AI can become a powerful force for positive change in the corporate world, benefiting both employees and the bottom line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3110)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Though we claim to be unbiased and make fair judgments, subconscious biases do creep in and tend to make evaluations unfair and inaccurate. There are a few ways in which you can make performance evaluations fair and equitable.\n\n\n\n\nClear evaluation criteria\n: It is crucial to have clear and consistent parameters for performance evaluations. This results in more objective evaluations rather than subjective judgments. You can set SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound) goals\n\n\nTraining and awareness\n: Along with specific goals, you can offer training programs for leaders and managers to help them understand biases and cultivate measures to keep them away during evaluations. Training will help you promote fair evaluations\n\n\nConduct 360-degree feedback\n: Instead of one employee sharing their point of view, it is ideal to take feedback from multiple associates. This should include peers, subordinates, seniors, as well as clients (if needed). A holistic view of an employee will result in a fair and unbiased evaluation\n\n\nAllow self-evaluation\n: An employee should also be given the chance to share their views, outlook, and approach toward work. This might eliminate some of the biases that the manager might have\n\n\nConduct regular check-ins\n: These evaluations should not be a one-time affair. There should be regular check-ins between managers and employees to have a clear understanding of work and performance\n\n\n\n\nWith these methods in mind, you can reduce biases and foster a workplace culture of inclusion and creativity.

We will take care of the questions and profiling activities and keep you in the loop to maintain complete transparency.\n\n\nAccess to hidden talent pool: \nWhat about those candidates who are exceptionally talented but are not actively looking for a job?

    "content": "Are AI Recruitment Tools Smarter Than An Executive Search Consultant?\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nWednesday, September 20, 2023\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence has an impact on all industries across the world, including the field of recruitment. More than 40% of all global MNCs are banking on AI-based software and tools to enhance their recruitment process. However, let us address the elephant in the room – will AI recruitment tools replace \nexecutive search consultants\n? Are these tools smarter than the experts with years of commerical and recruitment experience? The answer is an absolute ‘NO’.\n\n\nTechnology has always complemented human activities, and AI is no exception. We should not stay away from AI, but rather embrace it and adopt it to make lives easier. AI has numerous applications in the field of \nexecutive search services\n and can definitely enhance our services, however; it is not a silver bullet. Hence, there would always be certain activities that would require the human brain to \nextrapolate\n \ninformation, since AI tools cannot understand the nuances of a project like a experienced \nexecutive recruitment consultant.\n\n\nMore than 60% of recruiters are using AI tools to accelerate the process or enhance basic research activities. Some of the potential uses can include: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparing job descriptions for different jobs using gender-neutral and unbiased language\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving emails and reachouts to potential candidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanning the scheduling of interviews and meetings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are not exhaustive cases. The point is AI can be used in areas where there is a scope for automating repeated tasks or reducing human efforts and, hence accelerating the process. But the word out there is ‘cautious optimism’ – taking everything that AI generates \nVerbatim\n. Do not utilize the algorithms blindly because they can generate false or outdated information, have a lot of biases involved in their results, or might even have privacy and security threats.\n\n\nHaving said that, there are certain areas where AI cannot replace executive recruitment consultants. Let us explore some of them:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreative thinking\n: If tasks require out-of-the-box thinking then you need human experts. AI can only assist you or give you directional guidance, but it cannot think creatively and come up with transformational ideas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngage meaningfully with candidates\n: AI can come up with email templates or suggestive interview questions, but it cannot replace an expert when it comes to meaningful connections. It would not be able to comprehend human emotions, cultural nuances, and situational requirements while connecting with candidates or conducting an interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompletely eliminate biases\n: AI would generate results based on its training data. If you feed data that shows that historically men have been recruited for data operator jobs, then it would screen out or eliminate women from its search results. Such biases or skewed responses are very common, and one cannot eliminate biases from an AI algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake informed decisions\n: While AI can assist finding the right direction, it cannot make decisions for you. It can share information, but the informed decision would come from an experienced executive search consultant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, we should remember that AI is a  tool, a piece of technology – the choice of how it gets deployed is still in the hands of a human being. \nTo know more about our services like \nexecutive search management consulting\n, leadership coaching and professional hiring, reach out to us at \nwww.taplowgroup.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (5197)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Isn’t it? However, many times it is simply regarded as an administrative task. And why just profits and strategic goals, performance management is also essential to maximize the potential of your workforce. Companies must regularly plan to observe and evaluate employee performance and take necessary steps to enhance it.\n\n\nHere are the top 5 reasons why businesses must concentrate on performance management:\n\n\nIt Helps Employees Align with Organizational Goals\n\n\nA proper performance management mechanism in place will ensure that individual and team goals align with the broader objectives of the business. Employees must understand how their work contributes to the broader picture so that they are more motivated and engaged. This leads to a workforce that is focused on achieving the company's mission, a critical factor that is essential for sustainable growth and development.\n\n\nA Chance for Constant Learning and Improvement\n\n\nOrganizations must use performance management to create a culture of ongoing learning and growth for their workforce. Performance management is not only about annual reviews. Employees can work towards improvement by learning about their strengths and weaknesses through regular feedback and coaching sessions. This way they are empowered to take charge of their development and look for chances for progress,  thanks to this regular feedback cycle. Employees become increasingly valuable assets to the company as they advance in knowledge and skill.\n\n\nIdentifying High-Potential Talent\n\n\nCompanies can find high-potential workers who display remarkable talent and leadership potential by regularly applying the performance management approach. For succession planning and establishing a talent pipeline for future leadership roles, it is essential to identify and develop these individuals. Businesses can invest in the development and advancement of great performers by identifying them early creating a win-win for everyone.\n\n\nEnhancing Employee Engagement\n\n\nEngaged employees are more likely to put in extra efforts, leading to increased productivity and better business outcomes. Performance management plays a pivotal role in \nhuman capital development\n by fostering open communication, recognizing achievements, and addressing concerns promptly. Regular check-ins and feedback sessions provide employees with a platform to voice their opinions and feel valued within the organization.\n\n\nData-Driven Decision Making\n\n\nBy tracking performance metrics and analyzing trends, businesses can identify areas where additional resources or training are needed. Data-driven insights also facilitate fair and unbiased evaluations, reducing the risk of subjective judgments. Over time, this leads to a more equitable workplace where employees are rewarded based on their contributions.\n\n\nThe Taplow Group, a prominent \nhuman resource consulting firm\n, adds considerably to your company's performance by delivering helpful tools and knowledge focused at enhancing the abilities and knowledge of your workforce. We not only help you source the best-fit for your organization’s leadership through our executive search consultants but also train and develop them to hone their skills.\n\n\nTo know more about our human capital consultancy services like leadership coaching, professional hiring, and management consulting, reach out to us at www.taplowgroup.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (4307)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Here's how a strong commitment to social responsibility can help in this regard:\n\n\nAlignment with Values: \nMany job seekers, especially from younger generations, prioritize working for organizations that align with their personal values. When a company demonstrates a commitment to social responsibility through ethical business practices, environmental sustainability, and community engagement, it appeals to candidates who share these values. This alignment fosters a sense of purpose and belonging, making the organization more attractive to potential employees.\n\n\nEnhanced Reputation: \nCompanies known for their CSR initiatives tend to have a positive reputation in the job market. Prospective employees often research potential employers online, and a strong CSR record can significantly boost a company's image. A positive reputation can attract top talent who want to be associated with a socially responsible organization.\n\n\nEmployee Engagement: \nSocially responsible organizations often have more engaged employees. When employees feel their work contributes to a greater societal good, they tend to be more motivated and satisfied. This engagement is visible to potential candidates, making the organization a more attractive place to work.\n\n\nCompetitive Advantage: \nA strong commitment to social responsibility can set an organization apart from competitors in the talent market. When candidates see that an organization is not just about profits but also about making a positive impact on society, they may choose it over other options.\n\n\nCSR is not just a feel-good initiative; it's a strategic advantage in today's competitive talent market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3264)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Here are some of the challenges faced during confidential CEO searches and explore effective solutions to navigate these hurdles.\n\n\nMaintaining Discretion:\n Confidential CEO searches are undertaken for various reasons, including sensitive leadership transitions, succession planning, or avoiding market speculation. The challenge lies in maintaining complete discretion throughout the process. Leaks or rumors about a potential leadership change can have significant implications for the company's stability and reputation.\n\n\nLimited Candidate Pool:\n Such CEO search can limit the pool of potential candidates since many top-level executives may be reluctant to explore new opportunities due to concerns about their current employer discovering their job search. This scarcity of available candidates can pose challenges in identifying the ideal fit for the organization.\n\n\nIn-depth Assessment:\n Thorough evaluation of candidates becomes difficult due to the limited availability of public information. Confidentiality can restrict access to references, performance metrics, and other critical data that inform the assessment process.\n\n\nManaging Stakeholder Expectations:\n Companies undergoing a confidential CEO search must balance the need for secrecy with the expectations of various stakeholders, including employees, investors, and board members. Keeping stakeholders engaged and informed without revealing sensitive details requires careful communication.\n\n\n \n\n\nTaplow Solutions to Overcome Challenges include:\n\n\nStringent Confidentiality Protocols:\n Implement a robust set of confidentiality protocols that encompass all stages of the CEO search process. This includes signed non-disclosure agreements, clear communication guidelines, and secure information-sharing platforms.\n\n\nProactive Candidate Engagement\n: To overcome the limited candidate pool challenge, \nCEO recruiters\n \nshould have a wide network and a strong reputation for conducting confidential searches. They must discreetly approach potential candidates, ensuring the process remains confidential until the right candidate is identified.\n\n\nAdvanced Assessment Techniques:\n Utilize advanced assessment techniques such as in-depth behavioral interviews, psychometric assessments, and simulation exercises that provide insights into candidates' leadership abilities, decision-making skills, and cultural fit.\n\n\nCustomized Communication Strategy:\n Develop a customized communication strategy that addresses the concerns of different stakeholder groups. Sharing the rationale behind the confidential search, while maintaining the confidentiality of the candidates, can help manage expectations and build trust.\n\n\nClear Onboarding Plan: \nPlan the CEO's onboarding process carefully. Once the right candidate is selected, having a well-defined onboarding plan including a CEO Certification program can help them smoothly transition into their new role and align with the company's vision.\n\n\nOur confidential \nCEO search services\n are a complex undertaking that requires a delicate balance between maintaining secrecy and ensuring a successful leadership transition. Partnering with experienced executive search firms equipped with the expertise to handle these challenges can be a game-changer in achieving a seamless and successful CEO transition while safeguarding the organization's reputation.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, we offer a comprehensive range of services that encompass, Executive Recruitment, impactful coaching, robust leadership development, and expert guidance. Our goal is to ensure a seamless transition for candidates, enabling them to excel at their utmost potential.

    "content": "Pink Collar Empowerment: Equality, Opportunity, Success\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nThursday, August 24, 2023\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 3.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPink-collar jobs refer to occupations that have traditionally been associated with women, such as caregiving, nursing, administrative roles, retail, and hospitality. These jobs have often been undervalued and underpaid compared to roles traditionally held by men. However, when approached with a perspective of equality and opportunity, pink-collar jobs can play a significant role in promoting gender equality and success for all. Here's how:\n\n\nDismantling Gender Stereotypes\n: Embracing pink-collar jobs as opportunities for all genders helps challenge traditional gender stereotypes. When men and women have equal access to a wide range of occupations, it breaks down the notion that certain jobs are meant for specific genders.\n\n\nCreating a Balanced Workforce\n: Encouraging men to enter pink-collar fields increases workforce diversity. A balanced workforce fosters diverse viewpoints, problem-solving approaches, and creativity, which can lead to more innovative solutions and business success.\n\n\nReducing Gender Pay Gap:\n By promoting pink-collar jobs as valuable and equally important, organizations can help reduce the gender pay gap. Pay equity efforts benefit not only women but also men who pursue careers in these fields, as they won't be subject to discriminatory pay practices.\n\n\nEmpowering Economic Independence\n: Equal opportunity in pink-collar jobs empowers both men and women to achieve economic independence. This is essential for personal development, self-esteem, and overall well-being, regardless of gender.\n\n\nChanging Workplace Dynamics\n: A diverse workforce with individuals from various backgrounds and experiences contributes to a more inclusive and dynamic workplace culture. This can foster mutual respect, collaboration, and a greater sense of belonging.\n\n\nSupporting Work-Life Balance:\n Many pink-collar jobs, such as caregiving and nursing, emphasize empathy and interpersonal skills. Encouraging both men and women to enter these fields can contribute to a more supportive work environment, promoting work-life balance and employee well-being.\n\n\nCatalyzing Policy Changes\n: As more men join pink-collar professions, there may be an increased awareness of the challenges faced by women in the workforce. This collective understanding can lead to policy changes that support better work conditions, parental leave, and flexible work arrangements.\n\n\nRole Modeling for Future Generations\n: When children see adults breaking down gender stereotypes by pursuing diverse careers, it can inspire them to explore their interests without restrictions. This can contribute to a more inclusive and equitable society in the long term.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (4700)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "5 Ways Executive Search Consulting Firms Are Paving the Way for Gender Equality in Leadership\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nTuesday, August 22, 2023\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGender diversity in leadership is no longer just a buzzword; it's a pivotal driver of organizational success. However, despite the progress that has been made, gender barriers persist in boardrooms and C-suites around the world. Here’s how \nexecutive search consultant firms\n are playing an instrumental role in dismantling these barriers and promoting gender equality in leadership positions.\n\n\nWhile strides have been taken toward gender equality, a significant gap remains at the highest echelons of corporate leadership. According to recent studies, women hold only a fraction of senior executive roles, and even fewer occupy CEO positions. Addressing this imbalance requires a multifaceted approach, and executive search firms are positioned to effect real change.\n\n\nShattering Stereotypes Through Search\n\n\nExecutive search services\n are at the forefront of change by challenging gender stereotypes that have long influenced hiring decisions. Instead of perpetuating the status quo, these firms actively seek candidates who break the mold. By embracing diversity and actively searching for underrepresented talent, they are shifting the narrative surrounding leadership capabilities.\n\n\nRedefining 'Fit'\n\n\nOne of the ways executive search firms are breaking gender barriers is by redefining what it means to be a 'fit' for a leadership role. Rather than adhering to outdated notions of leadership, these firms are recognizing the unique strengths that each candidate brings to the table. This approach not only opens doors for women but also enriches leadership teams with diverse perspectives.\n\n\nCultivating a Pipeline of Talent\n\n\nBreaking gender barriers is a long-term endeavor that requires nurturing a pipeline of diverse talent. Executive search services are actively partnering with organizations to create mentorship and development programs aimed at grooming women for leadership roles. By identifying and nurturing emerging talent, these firms are addressing the root causes of the gender gap.\n\n\nChampioning Transparency and Accountability\n\n\nExecutive search firms are also driving change by promoting transparency and accountability in the search process. They are challenging their clients to set clear diversity goals and hold themselves accountable for meeting them. This push for transparency not only encourages organizations to take action but also holds executive search firms themselves to higher standards.\n\n\nShaping Organizational Culture\n\n\nBeyond placing candidates in leadership roles, executive search firms are influencing organizational culture. By advocating for inclusive practices and advising on diversity initiatives, they are helping companies create environments where women can thrive. This cultural shift is essential for ensuring that gender equality isn't just a momentary trend but a lasting transformation.\n\n\nThe role of \nexecutive search consultant firms\n in breaking gender barriers cannot be overstated. Through their commitment to challenging stereotypes, redefining 'fit,' cultivating talent pipelines, promoting transparency, and shaping organizational culture, these firms are driving meaningful change in the world of leadership. As they continue to champion gender diversity, we can expect to see a future where gender equality is not an aspiration but a reality in boardrooms and C-suites across industries.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, we are implementing structured and unbiased evaluation methods, ensuring that candidates are assessed solely on their qualifications and potential, rather than their gender.

Here’s how organizations can foster a learning culture and employ effective strategies for continuous \nhuman capital development.\n\n\nThe Importance of a Learning Culture\n\n\nA learning culture is an environment in which learning is not limited to formal training sessions but becomes an integral part of daily work life. It encourages employees at all levels to seek knowledge, share insights, and continuously improve their skills. Organizations with a strong learning culture tend to have more engaged employees, higher retention rates, and a workforce that is better equipped to navigate challenges and seize opportunities.\n\n\nStrategies for Building a Learning Culture\n\n\nLead by Example: Creating a learning culture begins at the top. Leaders and managers should actively participate in learning initiatives, showcase their commitment to growth, and encourage others to do the same. When employees see leadership embracing learning, they are more likely to follow suit.\n\n\nProvide Access to Learning Resources: Offer a diverse range of learning resources, including online courses, workshops, webinars, and reading materials. By providing easy access to relevant resources, you empower employees to take charge of their learning journey.\n\n\nEmbrace Continuous Feedback: Regular feedback sessions create an environment of continuous improvement. Encourage managers to provide constructive feedback and support employees' skill development through targeted recommendations for growth.\n\n\nEncourage Knowledge Sharing: Foster a culture where employees are encouraged to share their expertise and insights with others. Implement platforms or forums for knowledge exchange, whether through in-person sessions or virtual collaboration tools.\n\n\nIncorporate Learning into Workflows: Embed learning opportunities directly into employees' daily tasks. For example, create micro-learning modules that can be accessed during short breaks, ensuring learning becomes seamlessly integrated into their work routine.\n\n\nRecognize and Reward Learning Achievements: Acknowledge and celebrate employees' commitment to learning. Recognize milestones, certifications, and achievements publicly to reinforce the value of continuous development.\n\n\nPromote Cross-Functional Learning: Encourage employees to explore learning beyond their immediate roles. Cross-functional training and job rotations can broaden perspectives and equip employees with a holistic understanding of the organization.\n\n\nOffer Personalized Learning Paths: Recognize that employees have diverse learning preferences and goals. Provide opportunities for individualized learning paths to cater to their unique needs and aspirations.\n\n\nCollaborative Learning Initiatives: Encourage collaborative learning through group projects, peer mentoring, and collaborative problem-solving. Learning from colleagues can enhance both knowledge acquisition and teamwork.\n\n\nMeasure and Assess Learning Impact: Implement tools to measure the impact of learning initiatives on employee performance and organizational outcomes. Use data-driven insights to refine and improve the learning culture strategy.\n\n\nBenefits of a Learning Culture\n\n\nA learning culture holds the potential to bring about increased employee engagement as it demonstrates to the workforce that their professional development is highly regarded and actively supported by the organization. Furthermore, this culture enhances adaptability by providing employees with the essential skills to effectively navigate dynamic industry landscapes and embrace technological advancements. Moreover, a workforce that is well-versed and knowledgeable can adeptly tackle challenges, resulting in efficient problem-solving that minimizes disruptions. Such a culture also adds to the allure of an organization's employer brand, attracting top-tier talent that seeks out opportunities for professional advancement and development.\n\n\nBuilding a learning culture is not without challenges. Resistance to change, time constraints, and aligning learning initiatives with business goals can be hurdles. Overcoming these challenges requires strong leadership support, effective communication, clear alignment with organizational objectives, and the integration of learning into everyday work.\n\n\nThe Taplow Group is a leading \nhuman resource consulting firm\n. We help to nurture and refine your human capital’s skill sets through training and development initiatives.\n\n\nAs industries evolve, organizations with a learning culture are poised to thrive, adapt, and remain competitive in the ever-changing business landscape.

One strategic approach that has gained significant traction in recent years is executive interim management. This approach involves bringing in seasoned executive professionals on a temporary basis to lead and manage transformation initiatives. Here are five key advantages of leveraging executive interim management for organizational transformation.\n\n\n1. Immediate Expertise and Experience\n\n\nOne of the primary advantages of \nexecutive interim management\n is immediate access to a pool of experienced executives who possess specialized skills and knowledge. These professionals have a track record of successfully leading transformations in various industries. Their expertise allows them to quickly diagnose issues, develop tailored strategies, and execute plans that align with the organization's goals.\n\n\n2. Accelerated Decision-Making and Execution\n\n\nIn times of transformation, the speed of decision-making and execution is critical. Executive interim managers bring a proactive and action-oriented approach, as they are accustomed to operating in high-pressure environments. Their ability to swiftly assess situations, make informed decisions, and drive execution helps organizations achieve transformation goals within compressed timelines.\n\n\n3. Unbiased Perspective and Objectivity\n\n\nOur \nexecutive interim management\n offers an unbiased perspective that can be invaluable during periods of change. They are not bound by internal politics or preconceived notions, enabling them to objectively assess the organization's challenges, strengths, and weaknesses. This objectivity often leads to innovative solutions and the identification of opportunities that might have been overlooked.\n\n\n4. Limited Disruption to Existing Leadership\n\n\nHiring permanent C-suite executives for a transformational phase can sometimes disrupt the existing leadership structure. Executive interim managers step into their roles seamlessly, allowing the current leadership team to focus on day-to-day operations. This ensures that the transformation initiative receives the undivided attention and expertise it requires without causing unnecessary disruption.\n\n\n5. Cost-Effectiveness and Flexibility\n\n\nTraditional leadership hires come with significant financial investments and long-term commitments. In contrast, executive interim management provides cost-effective solutions. Organizations can engage interim executives for the specific duration of the transformation project, avoiding the long-term financial obligations associated with permanent hires. This flexibility allows organizations to scale their resources according to the evolving needs of the transformation initiative.\n\n\nIn the ever-evolving business landscape, the advantages of leveraging executive interim management for organizational transformation are clear. The expertise, acceleration of decision-making, unbiased perspective, limited disruption to existing leadership, and cost-effectiveness offered by interim executives position organizations to navigate transformations successfully. By tapping into this specialized talent pool, organizations can drive impactful changes, adapt to market shifts, and position themselves for long-term success.\n\n\nNavigating the complexities of today's business landscape demands effective tools. Through our executive interim management services, we offer a crucial solution. By connecting organizations with seasoned professionals, we facilitate the overcoming of challenges and the seizing of opportunities. Whether your enterprise is undergoing a challenging transition or striving to achieve ambitious goals, interim management stands as a dependable ally.\n\n\nAs you embark on your transformation journey, consider harnessing the power of executive interim management to drive positive change and secure a prosperous future for your organization.

Here are five ways in which they can affect the hiring process:\n\n\nMissed Talent: \nA bad interview can cause a qualified candidate to perform poorly and not showcase their true potential. This leads to missing out on talented individuals who could have been valuable assets to the company.\n\n\nInaccurate Assessment: \nAn interview that fails to accurately assess a candidate's skills, qualifications, and cultural fit can result in hiring someone who is not a good fit for the position or the organization. This mismatch can lead to performance issues and a higher turnover rate.\n\n\nNegative Candidate Experience: \nA poor interview experience can leave candidates with a negative impression of the company. This could cause an exeptional person to decide not to pursue an opportunity and leave them with a negative impression of your company, potentially making it harder to attract top talent in the future.\n\n\nBias and Discrimination: \nInterviewers can inadvertently allow biases to influence hiring decisions. If interviewers are not properly trained or aware of their biases, they may overlook qualified candidates from diverse backgrounds, resulting in a lack of diversity within the organization.\n\n\nWasted Resources: \nConducting bad interviews takes up valuable time and resources of the hiring team. When a hiring decision is later reconsidered due to the shortcomings of the interview process, it wastes time and effort for both the company and the candidates involved.\n\n\nTo minimize the impact of bad interviews, organizations should invest in training interviewers and having the right processes in place to ensure effective interviewing techniques and ensuring they are aware of potential biases.

It is easy to see why! When you have people from different backgrounds and cultures you bring new ideas to the table, enhance your productivity, and grow your business in ways not known before.\n\n\nHowever, talking about D&I is one thing and implementing it is another different ball game. This is where a \nhuman resource consulting firm\n can come to your rescue. The consultants have years of experience across multiple industries and would help you establish and improve your D&I efforts across the entire organization.

This means that you are at the top of your human capital development and have a robust strategy in place that is aligned with the organizational values as well as with the different departments and business practices.\n\n\nGet employees involved:\n \nThe strategy would work best when you have the buy-in from all employees within your organization. This means that we would involve your employees in this strategy. They would be trained on the importance of D&I; learning how to embrace it and in turn, practice it in their respective teams and functions. This creates a sense of ownership, and the D&I percolates through the organization till the last mile executives.\n\n\nEnhance your talent practices:\n Coming to hiring and onboarding, you need to work on your talent strategy. Right from making jobs accessible to all without any discrimination to ensuring that there is no bias involved at any stage of the recruitment process, we will help you analyze and improve your hiring strategies.\n\n\nD&I training and resources:\n D&I is not a one-time process; it is more of an iterative process where you keep practicing it day in and day out. Hence, our\n human capital consultancy services\n are equipped with ongoing D&I training, as required. We conduct regular training and share valuable resources with your employees.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are looking at diversity and inclusion as your top human capital development priority, then visit \nwww.taplowgroup.com\n to speak to a specialist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2665)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

It is a crucial process for any enterprise looking at long-term success and resilience:\n\n\nIdentify key positions: \nIt is essential for enterprises to identify key positions within the leadership hierarchy.

Executive recruitment consultants are there to help you. They would train and prepare leaders within your enterprise and can also give you access to a wide pool of external candidates, even passive ones.\n\n\nSuccessful onboarding plans: \nOnce your candidates are identified , they will need some supporting before they start delivering on their expectations. Executive recruitment consultants will assist you in training the new candidates and making them comfortable with the enterprise and its nuances. This makes them ready to take up the role and deliver on it successfully. By offering onboarding support, the executive consultants ensure that the transition happens with minimal disruptions to business.\n\n\nConfidentiality and transparency: \nWhen it comes to leadership planning, you cannot go about beating the drums across the enterprise or in the market. These things require a certain level of discretion and confidentiality, and the recruitment experts know their game very well. They can handle complex situations, sensitive discussions, and maintain the right level of transparency at the same time.\n\n\nContinuous talent pipeline: \nAt The Taplow Group, our executive search services enable companies identify and retain a talent pipeline for leadership positions.

Avoid Making These Mistakes\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nMonday, July 3, 2023\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecoming a boss for the first time can be both exciting and challenging. To help you navigate this new role successfully, here are some common mistakes to avoid:\n\n\nMicromanaging\n - Resist the temptation to control every aspect of your team's work. Micromanaging can stifle creativity, demotivate employees, and hinder productivity. Instead, trust your team members' abilities and provide guidance and support when needed.\n\n\nLack of Communication\n - Communication is key to effective leadership. Failing to communicate clearly and consistently with your team can lead to misunderstandings, decreased morale, and decreased productivity. Be open, transparent, and accessible, and encourage two-way communication.\n\n\nFailure to Delegate\n - Trying to do everything yourself is a recipe for burnout and limits your team's growth. Delegate tasks based on individual strengths and give team members opportunities to develop new skills. This fosters a sense of ownership, empowerment, and teamwork.\n\n\nIgnoring Employee Development\n - Your team members are your most valuable asset. Neglecting their professional growth and development can lead to disengagement and high turnover. Provide opportunities for training, mentorship, and career advancement to help them reach their full potential.\n\n\nNot Providing Feedback\n - Regular feedback is crucial for employee growth and performance improvement. Avoid the mistake of only providing feedback during annual reviews. Instead, provide timely and constructive feedback, both positive and areas for improvement, to help your team members succeed.\n\n\nLack of Emotional Intelligence\n - Emotional intelligence is essential for effective leadership. Failing to understand and manage your emotions, as well as empathize with your team members, can create a negative work environment. Cultivate self-awareness, practice active listening, and show empathy towards your team's needs and concerns.\n\n\nAvoiding Difficult Conversations \n- It's natural to want to avoid uncomfortable conversations, but avoiding them can create bigger problems in the long run. Address issues promptly and respectfully, providing constructive criticism and working together to find solutions.\n\n\nNeglecting Work-Life Balance\n - As a new boss, you may feel the pressure to constantly be available and dedicated to your work. However, neglecting your own work-life balance can prove costly and impact your effectiveness as a leader. Set boundaries, prioritize self-care, and encourage your team to maintain a healthy work-life balance as well.\n\n\nRemember, being a first-time boss is a learning experience\n. Stay open to feedback, be willing to adapt, and continuously seek opportunities to grow as a leader. By avoiding these common mistakes, you can establish a positive and productive work environment for yourself and your team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3014)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

These firms play a vital role in this process by leveraging their expertise to identify and develop hidden talent that may not be readily apparent. Here’s how these firms go about identifying hidden talent and nurturing their potential.\n \nIn-Depth Research and Assessment\n \nExecutive search consultants invest significant time and resources in conducting comprehensive research and assessment to identify potential candidates.

By examining professional networks, industry events, and even scouting talent from competitors, these firms cast a wide net to identify individuals who possess the desired skills, experience, and potential.\n \nSpecialized Networks and Relationships\n \nExecutive search services often have extensive networks and relationships within specific industries or sectors. These networks grant them access to a pool of high-potential individuals who may not be visible through traditional channels. Through their connections and reputation, these consultants can tap into talent that is under the radar, providing organizations with opportunities to engage with individuals who possess exceptional skills and potential.\n \nAssessing Potential Beyond the Resume\n \nWhile resumes and professional backgrounds provide essential information, an\n \nexecutive search consultants firm\n delves deeper to assess a candidate's potential. They look beyond surface-level qualifications and evaluate factors such as leadership abilities, adaptability, problem-solving skills, and cultural fit. By utilizing various assessment tools, including interviews, psychometric tests, and competency evaluations, they gain valuable insights into a candidate's potential for growth and success.\n \nLong-Term Relationship Building\n \nExecutive search consultants understand the importance of building strong relationships with candidates, even those who may not be immediately suitable for a specific role. By nurturing long-term relationships, these firms develop a deep understanding of a candidate's aspirations, strengths, and areas for development. They stay in touch, provide guidance, and offer career advice, positioning themselves as trusted advisors in the talent management process.\n \nProfessional Development and Coaching\n \nTo unlock hidden talent's full potential, \nexecutive search consultant firms\n often provide professional development opportunities and coaching to their candidates. They recognize that investing in a candidate's growth and skill enhancement can yield significant returns for both the candidate and the organization. Through mentoring, leadership programs, and access to relevant resources, these firms facilitate the development of essential competencies and help individuals reach their full potential.\n \nPerfect Placement\n \nOnce a hidden talent is identified and nurtured, executive search consultants excel in matching the candidate with the right organization and opportunity. Their deep understanding of organizational culture, strategic goals, and team dynamics allows them to make well-informed recommendations. By ensuring a strong alignment between the candidate's aspirations and the organization's needs, these firms facilitate successful placements that benefit both parties.\n \nIn a world where talent is a critical differentiator, executive search services play a pivotal role in identifying and nurturing hidden talent. Through extensive research, specialized networks, and in-depth assessments, these firms uncover individuals with exceptional potential. By building relationships, providing development opportunities, and facilitating suitable placements, they help organizations harness the untapped capabilities of these individuals, ultimately driving organizational success and growth.\n \nTo know more about our services like executive search management consulting, leadership coaching, professional hiring, and management consulting, reach out to us at www.taplowgroup.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2224)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Additionally, akin to previous generations, they have unique expectations from their employers and work life, which are fundamentally reshaping the workplace. Unlike their predecessors, millennials exhibit no reluctance in seeking new job opportunities if they find their current ones unsatisfactory. In fact, Gallup estimates that millennial turnover costs the U.S. economy a staggering $30.5 billion annually.\n\n\nMillennials are catalysts for change, actively challenging conventional norms and systems. They champion innovative approaches and envision new possibilities for how things can be accomplished. Their drive for transformation extends beyond surface-level improvements; they seek to address the underlying issues and drive meaningful progress.\n\n\nMoreover, millennials tend to place a high value on purpose, meaning, and social impact in their work and lives. They are driven by a desire to create a positive difference and seek environments that align with their values. This inclination towards change stems from their aspiration for a better future and a genuine belief that it can be achieved.\n\n\nAs a result, millennials often champion causes such as sustainability, diversity and inclusion, work-life balance, and social justice. They actively seek out organizations and leaders who share their vision and are willing to challenge conventional practices to effect meaningful change.\n\n\nIn parallel to the drive for change by millennials in the workplace, HR professionals must embrace a similar mindset. Merely making incremental improvements is no longer sufficient; they must strive for meaningful and impactful transformations.\n\n\nIt is crucial for HR leaders to recognize that they need not be millennials themselves in order to initiate change. The ability to drive transformation goes beyond generational boundaries.

Executive interim management has emerged as a powerful solution for driving business transformation. Let’s explore executive interim management's key benefits and considerations and how it can help organizations navigate periods of change and achieve their transformation goals.\n\n\nThe Nature of Business Transformation\n\n\nBusiness transformation involves making significant changes to an organization's strategy, processes, and culture to adapt to evolving market dynamics and seize new opportunities. It requires strong leadership, expertise, and a strategic mindset. However, many organizations face hurdles in finding the right talent internally or may require immediate leadership during transitional periods. This is where \ninterim management services\n step in, offering an agile and strategic approach to drive business transformation.\n\n\nLeveraging External Expertise\n\n\nOne of the primary advantages of interim executive management is the ability to tap into external expertise. Interim managers bring a wealth of experience from diverse industries and have a proven track record of delivering results in challenging environments. Their fresh perspective and broad skill set allow them to quickly assess an organization's needs, develop a transformation roadmap, and implement effective strategies. They can provide objective insights, challenge existing norms, and introduce innovative solutions, accelerating the pace of change.\n\n\nFlexibility and Agility\n\n\nExecutive interim management offers organizations flexibility and agility, two critical elements in business transformation. Interim managers can be brought in for specific projects, to fill leadership gaps, or during periods of organizational change. Unlike traditional permanent hires, interim managers can swiftly adapt to new environments, mobilize teams, and implement change initiatives with minimal disruption. Their ability to hit the ground running and focus solely on transformational goals allows organizations to make significant progress within shorter timeframes.\n\n\nCost-Effectiveness\n\n\nCost-effectiveness is a compelling advantage of executive interim management. Hiring an interim manager is typically more affordable than recruiting a permanent executive. Organizations can avoid long-term financial commitments, including salaries, benefits, and relocation packages, which can be particularly advantageous during times of uncertainty or short-term projects. Additionally, interim managers are focused on delivering specific outcomes within a defined timeframe, ensuring organizations get maximum value for their investment.\n\n\nKnowledge Transfer and Skill Development\n\n\nExecutive interim managers drive immediate business transformation and contribute to knowledge transfer and skill development within the organization. Through their expertise and hands-on approach, they share best practices, mentor internal teams, and enhance overall capabilities. This knowledge transfer empowers internal talent, building a strong foundation for sustained success beyond the interim management period.\n\n\nIn an era of constant change and transformation, \nexecutive interim management services\n emerge as a strategic solution for organizations seeking rapid results. By leveraging executive interim services, organizations can tap into the expertise, leadership, and flexibility offered by experienced professionals, helping them navigate critical junctures and achieve their strategic objectives effectively. At The Taplow Group, our executive interim management services provide flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and knowledge transfer capabilities.

Technology has revolutionized how organizations manage their workforce, from streamlining processes and enhancing efficiency to improving data management and analysis. By leveraging technology solutions such as HRMS, ATS, analytics tools, and e-learning platforms, organizations can optimize talent acquisition, develop a data-driven approach to decision-making, and enhance the overall employee experience. Embracing technology is no longer optional but essential for organizations seeking to stay competitive, attract top talent, and drive sustainable growth in today’s fast-paced business landscape.\n\n\nHere are the key benefits it brings to both organizations and HR professionals.\n\n\nEnhanced Talent Acquisition:\n\n\nTechnology has reshaped the way organizations attract and acquire talent. The advent of applicant tracking systems (ATS) has automated and simplified the recruitment process, allowing HR professionals to efficiently manage job postings, track applicants, and streamline candidate screening. Additionally, digital platforms and social media have opened up new avenues for reaching and engaging with a wider pool of candidates, expanding the reach of organizations and creating more diverse talent pipelines.\n\n\nAdvanced Data Analytics:\n\n\nTechnology has enabled the collection and analysis of vast amounts of data, leading to data-driven decision-making in human capital services. HR analytics platforms leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to analyze employee data, identify trends, and provide valuable insights into workforce dynamics. This data-driven approach empowers HR professionals to make informed decisions on talent management, succession planning, employee engagement, and performance evaluation.\n\n\nPersonalized Learning and Development:\n\n\nWith technology, learning and \nhuman capital development\n initiatives have become more accessible and personalized. Online learning platforms, virtual classrooms, and e-learning modules have made it easier for organizations to provide continuous learning opportunities to their employees. Adaptive learning systems leverage algorithms to customize training programs based on individual needs, preferences, and skill gaps. This not only enhances employee engagement and knowledge retention but also ensures that the workforce remains equipped with the latest skills and competencies.\n\n\nStreamlined HR Operations:\n\n\nAutomation and digitalization have greatly streamlined HR operations, freeing up HR professionals from time-consuming administrative tasks. HR management systems (HRMS) and human resource information systems (HRIS) centralize employee data, automate payroll processing, facilitate leave management, and simplify performance reviews. This enables HR teams to focus on strategic initiatives such as talent development, employee engagement, and organizational culture.\n\n\nImproved Employee Experience:\n\n\nTechnology has played a pivotal role in enhancing the employee experience throughout the employee lifecycle. Self-service portals and mobile applications enable employees to access HR services, update personal information, request time off, and access relevant documents conveniently. Chatbots and AI-powered virtual assistants provide instant support for common HR queries, ensuring employees receive prompt and accurate responses. Moreover, remote work technologies and collaboration tools have enabled flexible work arrangements, promoting work-life balance and employee well-being.\n\n\nTechnology has revolutionized human capital services by bringing automation, analytics, and enhanced experiences to the forefront. HR professionals are now empowered to make data-driven decisions, optimize talent acquisition, and improve employee engagement. Embracing and leveraging technology in human capital services is not just a trend but a necessity for organizations to stay competitive and future-ready.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, a leading \nhuman resources consulting firm\n, we help businesses thrive by providing valuable resources and expertise to manage their human capital.

The executive leaders are the ones that run your business and are responsible for the company’s growth and profits. For these crucial positions, you cannot just rely on any recruitment firm because even the slightest mistake can cost millions of dollars. Hence, you need to partner with the best executive search firms that have experienced \nexecutive search consultants\n to help you source the best candidates for your senior leadership.\n\n\nSo, what makes them different? Two things that set them apart are – these executive search consultants have a wide network of candidates and also access passive candidates. At the same time, these experts prepare tailor-made recruitment strategies for you. They do not go headhunting with a one-size-fits-all policy and ensure that they strategize according to your needs and priorities.\n\n\nLet us take a further look into the role of executive search consultants in successful talent acquisition – \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess to a wide pool of candidates:\n These executive recruitment consultants have access to the most talented individuals in the job market, and most importantly, access to passive candidates. In general, very few people actively seek leadership or C-suite positions. These roles tend to be filled mostly through passive hiring. These experts have the best network and will help you get access to the right candidates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplete transparency and discretion\n: You will have 100% discretion throughout the process. You cannot fill in C-suite roles with walk-ins and mass media advertisements. Sometimes you need confidentiality throughout the process and the experts ensure that you have one. At the same time, they ensure you have 100% transparency in the process, where your inputs are being considered in each and every step and you have full knowledge of the entire flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBring diversity to your senior leadership\n: Having a diverse set of leaders is always a boon. But it is an equally daunting task to find one. This is where the role of executive search consultants comes into the picture. These folks will help you increase the diversity in your C-suite. In turn, it helps you bring more creativity to the table, talk about diverse ideas, and broaden the outlook of the overall leadership for your organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave your resources:\n Save your time and money with \nexecutive search services\n. Surprised? How do you save money? Yes! You do! Think about the extensive search you had to put in to access candidates, then the costs related to interviewing and hiring them. Let us not forget the opportunity cost in case your decision turned out to be a mistake. The idea of time saved is a no-brainer. Hence, overall, you end up saving on your resources – both time and money which can be invested in your core business activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n By now you must have realized the role of executive search consulting firms and the value-add they bring to the whole recruitment process. If you are looking to hire the right candidate for your organization, then you should leave it to the experts. They will take care of everything.\n\n\nTo know more about our services like \nexecutive search management consulting\n, leadership coaching, professional hiring, and management consulting, reach out to us at www.taplowgroup.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (1760)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Almost all departments in an organization have been transformed, so, how can HR be far behind.\n\n\nThe irony here is that HR stands for Human Resources and to manage human resources we need AI. Traditionally, the HR department of an organization is process heavy. After all, managing the expectations of the employees, management, job applicants and other stakeholders is a mammoth task. And just like any other technology, using ChatGPT also has its pros and cons.\n\n\nHere are some scenarios where ChatGPT could be successfully put to use in HR:\n\n\nOptimize effectiveness\n- ChatGPT can handle many routine tasks that would otherwise take up a lot of time, like collecting and sending out information to prospective job applicants. This can bring down the time involved hiring considerably.\n\n\nIncrease efficiency\n- Since it provides quick responses, ChatGPT can be used to boost efficiency. It can free up the time of HR to do other human-centric strategies.\n\n\nAvailability\n- Since it is available 24x7, it can provide quick responses to queries.\n\n\nHowever, when it comes to active talent management and executive search\n, it is too early to judge. Executive search thrives on the human touch, and it would be difficult for AI to replace it. ChatGPT is based on a lot of text data and therefore it cannot display emotional intelligence which is the basic tenet of executive search. Things like leadership style, cultural fit, and personal attributes cannot be evaluated by AI.\n\n\nHow do you think ChatGPT will transform your industry?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2330)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

It is changing not only the way we operate but also the way organizations view \nhuman capital development\n. It is indisputable that a company's human capital is one of its most valuable assets, and companies go to great lengths to attract and keep the best employees.\n\n\nUpskilling and Reskilling\n\n\nThe abilities required to do particular jobs are changing as a result of the advancement of technology. Workers will need to regularly reskill and upskill to stay current with the newest technologies if they want to stay competitive. To ensure that their staff members have the abilities necessary to carry out their tasks, employers must also invest in their training. Programs for developing human capital will therefore need to become more flexible and responsive to emerging technology.\n\n\nRemote Work\n\n\nThe trend towards remote work has been hastened by the pandemic, and many experts predict that it will continue to grow in popularity over time. Companies will need to make investments in technologies that make remote work and collaboration possible. Programs for developing human capital must emphasize training staff on how to function efficiently in a remote setting and how to use technology to stay connected and productive.\n\n\nAutomation\n\n\nWorkers will need to gain complementary abilities, like critical thinking and problem-solving, as more tasks are mechanized. The development of these skills and instruction on how to work with robots alongside them will be the main objectives of \nhuman capital development programs\n.\n\n\nThe Role of AI\n\n\nCurrently used to automate a variety of processes, artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to completely transform the workforce. Initiatives to improve human capital must concentrate on teaching staff how to work together with AI systems and assisting them in developing and implementing AI solutions.\n\n\nThe Gig Economy\n\n\nThe gig economy is growing rapidly, and it is changing the way people work. Human capital development programs will need to focus on developing skills that are in demand in the gig economy, such as entrepreneurship, networking, and marketing.\n\n\nIn conclusion, technology will continue to have a profound impact on human capital development and the future of work. To remain competitive, workers will need to continuously upskill and reskill, and employers will need to invest in their employees' training. \nHuman capital development\n programs will need to be agile and responsive to changing technologies, and they will need to focus on developing skills that complement automation and AI. The future of work is uncertain, but by investing in human capital development, companies and workers can prepare for whatever the future holds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3483)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

They are the masters when it comes to job fitment of a career. But how do you attract the attention of an executive recruiter?\n\n\nHere are some time-tested strategies!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know that LinkedIn is the best place to attract an executive recruiter? So, update your profile with your latest professional achievements, a professional photo, and a description to see the clicks on your profile go up by manifold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeing proactive has never harmed anyone. If you think a specific recruiter specializes in your core industry or sector, don’t hesitate to connect and explore possible career opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocus on quality and not quantity when you are building your network amongst this community. Connecting with a couple of top-tier recruiters is better than wasting your time in dealing with mediocre ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe sure of what you want and then only approach an executive recruiter because a lot is riding on their reputation. For example, if you are not sure about making a job switch immediately, don’t waste an executive recruiter’s time. Also, they are experienced professionals and can sense your hesitation immediately. It would turn out to be a loss-making proposition for both of you as the executive recruiter would be vary of spending their exclusive time on you and you would end up losing lucrative career opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, our seasoned experts can help you zero in on your next opportunity. If you are considering switching industries or sectors, don’t hesitate to approach our experts for sound advice.

    "content": "Empower your business with fractional CXOs\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nThursday, April 27, 2023\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, we have seen a significant trend emerging in the business world - the rise of fractional CXOs. Fractional CXOs, or part-time executives, are experienced professionals who offer their services to multiple companies on a contract basis, providing expertise in specific areas of business.\n\n\nFractional CXOs have gained traction in many industries, particularly in startups and small businesses, where resources are limited, and hiring a full-time executive can be cost-prohibitive. By hiring a fractional CXO, businesses can access high-level expertise without the expense of a full-time employee, and without the commitment of a long-term contract.\n\n\nOne of the benefits of fractional CXOs is their ability to bring a fresh perspective to a company's challenges. By working with multiple companies, fractional CXOs gain exposure to a wide range of business models and industries. This breadth of experience allows them to offer unique insights and creative solutions that might not have been considered by a full-time executive with a narrower focus.\n\n\nAnother advantage of fractional CXOs is their flexibility. Companies can engage a fractional CXO for a specific project or period, allowing them to scale up or down as needed without committing to a long-term contract. This flexibility allows businesses to be more agile and responsive to changing market conditions.\n\n\nHowever, there are also potential downsides to fractional CXOs that should be considered. One concern is that a fractional CXO may not have the same level of commitment to the company as a full-time executive. Additionally, because they are not part of the company's day-to-day operations, there may be a risk of misalignment with the company's culture or goals.\n\n\nOverall, the trend towards fractional CXOs is an interesting development in the business world. While there are potential downsides to consider, the benefits of accessing high-level expertise on a flexible basis are compelling. As the business landscape continues to evolve, we can expect more companies to embrace this trend and reap the rewards of fractional CXOs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2959)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

As an \nexecutive search consultant\n, one is responsible for identifying and recruiting top-level talent for your clients. The clients are typically businesses that need to fill key leadership positions, such as CEO, CFO, or CMO. The executive search process is complex and time-consuming, requiring a thorough understanding of the client's needs, the candidate pool, market conditions, and the skills and experiences required to succeed in top-level positions. Therefore, one also needs to be skilled in assessing candidates' fit with the organization's culture, values, and strategic objectives.\n\n\nExecutive recruitment consultants handle sensitive and confidential information about their clients, candidates, and the search process. Confidentiality is a non-negotiable trait for an executive search consultant, as it is essential to build trust and maintain strong relationships with clients and candidates.\n\n\nHere are 5 reasons why confidentiality is a non-negotiable trait for an executive search consultant:\n\n\nBuilding Trust and Maintaining Strong Relationships\n\n\nAs an \nexecutive search consultant\n, your clients rely on you to find top-level talent for their organization. In order to do so, you must be able to build trust with your clients and maintain strong relationships throughout the search process. Confidentiality is key to building this trust. Your clients need to know that you will keep their sensitive information confidential, including financial information, strategic plans, and other proprietary data. If you fail to maintain confidentiality, you risk damaging the trust that your clients have in you, which could harm your reputation and make it more difficult to attract top-level talent in the future.\n\n\nProtecting Candidates' Privacy\n\n\nConfidentiality is also important in order to protect the privacy of the candidates you are considering for senior-level positions. Candidates trust you to handle their personal and professional information with the utmost confidentiality. Leaking a candidate's information could seriously damage their reputation and career prospects, as well as lead to legal repercussions for both you and your client. This could also deter other top-level candidates from wanting to work with you in the future.\n\n\nComplying with Regulations\n\n\nData protection laws and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), require executive search consultants to maintain strict confidentiality when handling personal data. Non-compliance with these regulations can lead to significant financial penalties and legal repercussions. Confidentiality is therefore crucial for executive search services in order to comply with these regulations and protect themselves and their clients from legal and financial risks.\n\n\nMitigating Risks\n\n\nExecutive search consultants have access to sensitive information, such as strategic plans. Maintaining confidentiality is necessary to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate the risk of data breaches or leaks. Confidentiality policies and procedures must be implemented and followed to ensure that information is protected at all times. By doing so, \nexecutive recruitment consultants\n can mitigate the risks associated with the sensitive information they handle, protecting their clients and themselves.\n\n\nMaintaining a Competitive Edge\n\n\nFinally, confidentiality is essential to maintaining a competitive edge in the executive search industry. Clients and candidates are more likely to work with consultants who prioritize confidentiality and integrity. If you are known to be careless with confidential information, you could damage your reputation and make it more difficult to attract top-level talent in the future. Conversely, consultants who are known for their strict adherence to confidentiality standards can gain a competitive edge in the market, attracting more clients and top-level candidates.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, a leading global executive search management consulting firm, we specialize in identifying and recruiting top-level talent for businesses around the world. As part of our commitment to delivering the highest quality search services, we maintain strict confidentiality throughout the entire search process.\n\n\nTo know more about our services like leadership coaching, professional hiring, and management consulting, reach out to us at www.taplowgroup.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3864)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

But transitioning from a management role to a leadership position can be challenging, and it's easy to get stuck in old habits. That's where a \ncertified CEO training program \ncan make a significant difference. Enrolling in such a program can help you transform your career by developing the skills and mindset needed to become a successful leader.\n\n\nFirst, let's define the difference between management and leadership. Management is focused on achieving operational goals and ensuring that processes and procedures are followed. Leadership, on the other hand, is about inspiring and motivating people to achieve a shared vision. It involves creating a culture of trust, empowerment, and collaboration, where individuals are encouraged to take risks, learn from failures, and innovate.\n\n\nA certified CEO training program can help you make the transition from a management mindset to a leadership mindset by providing you with the tools, techniques, and knowledge you need to lead effectively. Some of the key areas covered in a CEO certification program include:\n\n\nStrategic thinking\n: A CEO must be able to think strategically and develop a clear vision for the organization's future. A CEO certification program can help you develop the skills to analyze market trends, identify opportunities and threats, and make informed decisions that align with the organization's goals.\n\n\nCommunication\n: Effective communication is essential for building trust and inspiring others. A CEO training program can help you develop the skills to communicate your vision clearly, listen actively to others, and provide constructive feedback.\n\n\nEmotional intelligence:\n A CEO must be able to understand and manage their own emotions and those of others. A CEO training program can help you develop the emotional intelligence needed to create a positive work environment, build strong relationships, and resolve conflicts effectively.\n\n\nInnovation\n: A CEO must be able to drive innovation and foster a culture of creativity and experimentation. A CEO training program can provide you with the tools and techniques needed to generate new ideas, test them, and implement them effectively.\n\n\nTeam building\n: A CEO must be able to build and lead high-performing teams. A CEO training program can help you develop the skills to identify and recruit top talent, create a positive work environment, and empower individuals to take ownership of their work.\n\n\nIn conclusion\n, transitioning from management to leadership can be a challenging but rewarding journey. By investing in a \ncertified CEO training program\n, you can develop the skills and mindset needed to become an effective leader, inspire your team, and drive the success of your organization. Whether you are a seasoned executive or a new manager, a CEO training program can help you take your career to the next level.\n\n\nOne of the key benefits of our CEO training program is the opportunity to learn from experienced business leaders who have a wealth of knowledge and expertise. These leaders can provide you with valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities that exist in today's business landscape, as well as the skills and qualities needed to succeed as a CEO.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, our CEO search services are tailored to help you find the best-fit CEO for your organization.

They must possess a diverse skill set, including financial management, strategic thinking, communication, and leadership abilities. Their skills, knowledge, and experience can greatly impact the success or failure of the company. That's why it's crucial for CEOs to continuously develop and refine their leadership abilities. One way to do this is by considering a \nCertified CEO Training Program\n. \nHere are some reasons why every CEO should consider a CEO Training Program:\nGain New Insights and Perspectives:\n Even experienced CEOs can benefit from exposure to new ideas and perspectives. A CEO Training Program can provide a structured environment for learning and development, where CEOs can gain new insights into leadership practices and strategies.\n \nDevelop New Skills:\n CEOs are expected to be well-rounded leaders, possessing a variety of skillsets, including strategic planning, financial management, communication, and more. CEO certification can help CEOs develop new skills and hone existing ones, making them more effective leaders.\n \nLearn from Experts:\n Such Training Programs are often led by industry experts who have extensive experience in leadership and management. By learning from these experts, CEOs can gain valuable knowledge and insights that can help them navigate challenges and capitalize on opportunities.\n \nNetwork with Peers:\n These Training Programs provide opportunities for CEOs to connect with other leaders in their industry. This networking can be invaluable, as CEOs can learn from others' experiences, gain new perspectives, and build relationships that can help them grow their business.\n \nIncrease Credibility:\n By completing a Training Program, CEOs can demonstrate their commitment to professional development and leadership excellence. This can enhance their credibility with stakeholders, employees, and investors, and help position them for future success.\n \nA Training Program can provide CEOs with the tools and knowledge they need to be effective leaders and drive the success of their organization. By investing in their own development, CEOs can enhance their skills, gain new perspectives, and build relationships that can help them navigate challenges and capitalize on opportunities.\n \nTo sum it up, there is no question that CEO training is a critical piece of any organization's success.\n \nOne of the most important roles of a CEO is to set the tone for the company and create a vision for the future. Training can help CEOs learn how to develop and articulate a clear vision, as well as how to create a strategy to achieve that vision. CEOs also need to be able to effectively manage and lead their teams. Robust training can help CEOs learn the skills necessary to motivate and inspire their team, as well as how to delegate tasks and manage conflict. CEOs are also responsible for ensuring the financial health of their company. Such training can help CEOs learn how to make sound financial decisions, as well as how to manage risk.\n \nAt The Taplow Group, our \nCEO search services\n are tailored to help you find the best-fit CEO for your organization.

From technological advances to shifting demographics and globalization, the future of executive search is set to look quite different from the present. Here are some of the top global executive search trends to watch out for in the coming years.\n\n\nIncreased Use of AI and Machine Learning\n: As technology continues to advance, global executive search firms are incorporating AI and machine learning into their search processes. These technologies are already being used to analyze candidate data and identify patterns, automate certain tasks, and even communicate with candidates. As the technology continues to improve, we can expect to see even more sophisticated AI and machine learning applications in executive search.\n\n\nGreater Emphasis on Soft Skills\n: While technical skills will always be important, soft skills such as emotional intelligence, communication, and leadership are becoming increasingly critical for executive positions. Recruiters are placing greater emphasis on these skills when evaluating candidates for the leadership positions. With the rise of remote work and virtual collaboration, these skills are becoming even more important.\n\n\nFocus on Diversity and Inclusion\n: Diversity and inclusion have become essential components of successful searches. Firms are placing greater emphasis on building diverse leadership teams that can bring different perspectives, experiences, and skills to the table. When a team is made up of people with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives, they can bring a wider range of ideas and insights to the table, leading to better decision-making.\n\n\nGreater Flexibility in Work Arrangements\n: The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the trend towards remote work and flexible work arrangements. Search firms are adapting to this trend by prioritizing candidates who are comfortable working remotely and have experience managing remote teams.\n\n\nIncreased Globalization\n: \nGlobal executive search\n is becoming increasingly global, with firms searching for talent across borders and continents. This trend is being driven by the growing importance of emerging markets, as well as the increasing demand for cross-cultural expertise. With companies expanding their reach into new markets, the need for experienced professionals who can deal with cultural differences and manage an international team has never been greater. Those who have the skills to successfully integrate a foreign work force into a running system are in high demand and are essential to the success of any organization.\n\n\nGreater Emphasis on Sustainability\n: Sustainability is becoming an increasingly critical issue for businesses, and global executive search firms are taking notice. Firms are placing greater emphasis on recruiting candidates who have experience with sustainability initiatives, and who can help drive the transition towards a more sustainable future.\n\n\nAs the world changes, so does the way we work. These changes and trends will have a significant impact on the future of collaboration between organizations and executive search consultants. \n\n\nAbout The Taplow Group:\n\n\nThe Taplow Group is a leading \nGlobal Executive Search Consultants Firm\n with 21 partner firms across 5 continents.

This is especially true in knowledge-based industries where human capital is the most valuable asset. Organizations that invest in \nhuman capital development\n can reap many benefits, including increased productivity, innovation, and competitiveness.\n\n\n \n\n\nHuman capital development refers to the process of investing in employees' skills, knowledge, and abilities to improve their performance and productivity. Engaging and retaining top talent is critical to the success of any organization. It is essential to ensure that employees feel valued, challenged, and supported in their career growth.\n\n\nHere are some ways to engage and retain top talent:\n\n\n1. \nOffer Continuous Learning Opportunities\n\n\nOne of the most effective ways to engage and retain top talent is to provide them with continuous learning opportunities. This can include training, mentoring, coaching, and education. Employees who are continually learning are more likely to stay engaged, and they are also more likely to stay with the organization.\n\n\nProviding learning opportunities can also help employees develop new skills and competencies, which can lead to career growth and advancement within the organization. Offering training and development programs can help employees feel valued and appreciated, which can lead to increased job satisfaction and commitment.\n\n\n2. \nProvide Career Growth and Development Opportunities\n\n\nTop talent is always looking for opportunities for career growth and development. Providing employees with opportunities to advance their careers within the organization is essential to retaining top talent. This can include promotions, transfers, and job rotations.\n\n\nIt is important to provide clear career paths for employees, so they know what opportunities are available to them. Offering career development programs, such as leadership training, can also help employees develop the skills they need to succeed in higher-level positions.\n\n\n3\n. \nCreate a Positive Work Environment\n\n\nCreating a positive work environment is crucial to engaging and retaining top talent. A positive work environment can include a culture of open communication, work-life balance, recognition and rewards programs, and a focus on employee wellness.\n\n\nEmployees who feel valued and appreciated are more likely to stay with the organization. Recognition and rewards programs can help to show employees that their contributions are valued, while a focus on employee wellness can help to reduce stress and improve job satisfaction.\n\n\n4\n. \nOffer Competitive Compensation and Benefits\n\n\nOffering competitive compensation and benefits is critical to retaining top talent. Employees who feel that they are being paid fairly are more likely to stay with the organization. Offering benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans, and paid time off can also help to attract and retain top talent.\n\n\n5\n. \nProvide Opportunities for Feedback and Input\n\n\nProviding employees with opportunities to provide feedback and input is essential to engaging and retaining top talent. Employees who feel that their opinions are valued are more likely to stay with the organization. Providing regular feedback can also help employees to improve their performance and productivity.\n\n\n \n\n\nIt would not be an exaggeration to say that engaging and retaining top talent is critical to the success of any organization.

Finding the right leaders for non-profit organizations is not an easy task, but it is essential for their success. Our \nexecutive search services\n can help your non-profit find leaders who align with your mission and values. For example, a leader of a non-profit must have high levels of emotional intelligence, as they will be working with a diverse range of individuals who may have different needs and perspectives. They must also have a commitment to continuous learning and professional development, as the non-profit landscape is constantly evolving and changing.\n\n\n \n\n\nWhen selecting an executive search management consulting firm, it's important to look for one that specializes in the non-profit sector and has a track record of success in placing executives in similar roles. You should also consider their approach to candidate assessment, their communication and reporting practices.

The \nexecutive search consultant\n assisting you will help you craft job descriptions, identify key competencies, and assess candidates' fit with your organization's culture and mission.\n\n\nObjective and Unbiased Approach\n: We will provide an impartial perspective on candidates, evaluating them solely on their skills, experience, and fit with your organization's values. This helps eliminate biases and ensure a fair and objective hiring process.\n\n\nStreamlined Hiring Process\n: We can help you manage the entire hiring process, from identifying candidates to negotiating compensation packages.

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals are no longer an afterthought, but an essential part of any successful transformation agenda. Here’s how organizations can build ESG goals into their wider transformation agenda.\n\n\n \n\n\nDefine your ESG goals\n\n\nThe first step to building ESG goals into your transformation agenda is to define what those goals are. Your ESG goals should be specific, measurable, and aligned with your overall business objectives. This will help ensure that your ESG goals are realistic and achievable. Some examples of ESG goals include reducing carbon emissions, increasing diversity and inclusion, and improving supply chain transparency.\n\n\nIntegrate ESG goals into your business strategy\n\n\nOnce you’ve defined your ESG goals, it’s important to integrate them into your wider business strategy. This means incorporating ESG goals into your long-term planning, budgeting, and decision-making processes. By integrating ESG goals into your business strategy, you’ll be better positioned to achieve those goals and create long-term value for your business.\n\n\nBuild ESG considerations into your operations\n\n\nESG considerations should be built into your day-to-day operations. This includes everything from how you source materials and manage waste, to how you treat your employees and engage with your customers. Building ESG considerations into your operations will help ensure that you’re making progress towards your ESG goals on a daily basis.\n\n\nCommunicate your ESG goals and progress\n\n\nEffective communication is key to building ESG goals into your wider transformation agenda.

This expansion marks a significant milestone in our company's journey and reinforces our commitment to serving our clients across Europe.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe new office, strategically located in the heart of the European Quarter. The European Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee are in the immediate vicinity. The European Commission and the Berlaymont ( headquarters of the European Commission) are within walking distance. The district also called Leopold District was created after Belgian independence in 1830. That is when Brussels began to grow, and an upscale suburb was created on this site where the better citizens came to live. Between 1850 and 1914, Brussels experienced the Golden Age. Most of the houses here still date from that time. The birth of this European Quarter and the establishment of all the European institutions in the heart of Brussels has an eventful history. Everything begins in 1958 when, after the Treaties of Rome, something new was created that they called the Commission.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe believe that Brussels is an ideal location for our expansion, as it is home to many multinational companies and has a diverse and talented workforce. We are excited to be part of this vibrant business community and look forward to working closely with our clients and partners in the region.\n\n\n \n\n\nThis will allow us to better serve our clients in Belgium and surrounding regions, as well as strengthen our presence in the European executive search market. Our team of experienced consultants is well-equipped to help organizations find top talent for executive roles in various industries, including technology, finance, healthcare, and more.\n\n\n \n\n\nWith this new office, we are able to provide our clients with a more personalized, local service while leveraging our global network and resources. Our goal is to help organizations identify and attract the best talent, no matter where they are located, and this new office will enable us to do just that.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe will continue to uphold our values of integrity, excellence, and partnership, and provide our clients with the highest level of service and support. Our team is committed to building long-term relationships with our clients and helping them achieve their business goals through effective executive search and other human capital advisory services.\n\n\n \n\n\nThis is a significant step forward for our company, and we are excited about the opportunities it brings. We are confident that our local presence, combined with our global network and expertise, will enable us to deliver exceptional service to our clients and contribute to their success in the years to come.\n\n\n\n\nHow To Get There & Parking\n\n\nThe nearest airport is Brussels Airport, 12 km from the office. Parking is available near Rue Belliard, Avenue Cortenbergh, Avenue des Arts or Rue de la Loi. Here, you will find all the public and private car parks. Also, you can use the metro which allows you to reach the city center of Brussels.\n\n\n𝙋𝙡𝙚𝙖𝙨𝙚 𝙛𝙚𝙚𝙡 𝙛𝙧𝙚𝙚 𝙩𝙤 𝙗𝙤𝙤𝙠 𝙖𝙣 𝙖𝙥𝙥𝙤𝙞𝙣𝙩𝙢𝙚𝙣𝙩 𝙩𝙤 𝙙𝙞𝙨𝙘𝙪𝙨𝙨 𝙤𝙥𝙥𝙤𝙧𝙩𝙪𝙣𝙞𝙩𝙞𝙚𝙨 𝙤𝙧 𝙟𝙪𝙨𝙩 𝙝𝙖𝙫𝙚 𝙖 𝙜𝙤𝙤𝙙 𝙘𝙤𝙣𝙫𝙚𝙧𝙨𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣 𝙖𝙣𝙙 𝙖 𝙥𝙚𝙧𝙛𝙚𝙘𝙩 𝙘𝙤𝙛𝙛𝙚𝙚,\n connect to our Benelux Managing Partner,  Jeanjjj Theuns\n \nclick here to email Jean .\n\n\n \n\n\nAbout The Taplow Group\n\n\nEstablished in 2002, the group has 21 partner firms located in 38 offices across 20 countries.

Make sure your employees understand your vision and the role they play in achieving it. This will help keep everyone motivated and focused on the same goal.\n\n\nReview and adjust\n: Regularly review your short-term goals and adjust them as necessary to keep them aligned with your long-term vision. Remember, your vision may change over time, and it’s important to be flexible and adaptable.\n\n\nLead by example\n: As a leader, your actions set the tone for your company.

Understanding the vocabulary of sustainability is crucial for business leaders who want to make a positive impact on the world and ensure the long-term success of their company.\n\n\n \n\n\nHere are some of the key terms you need to know:\n\n\nSustainability: \nThis refers to the ability of a system to continue functioning without depleting natural resources or causing harm to the environment. In a business context, it means ensuring that the company operates in a way that is environmentally and socially responsible, while also being economically viable.\n\n\nTriple Bottom Line (TBL):\n This concept refers to the three pillars of sustainability: economic, social, and environmental. A business that prioritizes the TBL is committed to creating value for all stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, and the planet.\n\n\nCarbon footprint:\n This refers to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced by a company or individual. A low carbon footprint is a key aspect of sustainability, as it helps reduce the impact of climate change.\n\n\nCircular economy:\n This term refers to an economic system where waste and pollution are minimized, and resources are used and reused in a closed loop. The goal of a circular economy is to create a more sustainable and resilient economy, where natural resources are used efficiently.\n\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR):\n This refers to the responsibilities of a company to society and the environment. This includes initiatives like reducing waste, supporting local communities, and promoting ethical business practices.\n\n\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing:\n This refers to an investment approach that considers environmental, social, and governance factors in addition to financial performance. ESG investing has become increasingly popular in recent years, as more investors look for ways to align their investments with their values.\n\n\nNet-zero:\n This refers to a state where the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced is equal to the amount removed from the atmosphere. The goal of net-zero is to achieve a zero-carbon footprint, in order to reduce the impact of climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (1958)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Cross-cultural competence is the ability to understand, appreciate, and work effectively with people from different cultural backgrounds. It is a critical skill for executives who are working in a global context, as it helps them to effectively communicate and build relationships with diverse stakeholders. Global executive search firms play an important role in helping organizations find executives who possess cross-cultural competence.\n\n\nWe have a deep understanding of the cultural, economic, and political landscape of the countries in which we operate, and we use this knowledge to identify executives who have the skills and experience needed to succeed in cross-cultural environments.\n\n\nWorking with a \nglobal executive search services firm\n can provide several benefits for organizations seeking to fill executive positions internationally. Firstly, the firm can help identify and attract top talent from around the world, including candidates who may not have been actively seeking new opportunities. Secondly, the firm can help assess the cultural fit of candidates and ensure that they have the necessary cross-cultural competence to succeed in the new environment. Finally, the firm can provide support throughout the hiring process, including offering guidance on compensation packages and local regulations.\n\n\nCross-cultural competence is more than just an understanding of different customs and traditions. It involves an appreciation of the values, beliefs, and communication styles of different cultures, as well as an ability to adapt one's own behavior to better connect with people from different backgrounds. Executives who possess cross-cultural competence are more likely to be successful in building relationships, negotiating deals, and leading teams in a global context.\n\n\nIt leads to:\n\n\nImproved Collaboration :\n Cross-cultural competence helps to foster collaboration and build trust across different cultural backgrounds. This leads to more effective teamwork, better decision-making, and stronger relationships with partners and customers.\n\n\nEnhanced Market Penetration:\n A culturally competent executive can better understand the local market and its unique needs, which leads to more effective business strategies and improved market penetration.\n\n\nIncreased Innovation:\n A diverse and inclusive leadership team is more likely to bring fresh ideas and perspectives to the table, leading to increased innovation and creativity.\n\n\nBetter Understanding of Local Regulations and Customs:\n A culturally competent leader is better equipped to understand the local regulatory landscape and cultural customs, which can help avoid potential missteps and improve business outcomes.\n\n\nImproved Employee Retention:\n \nCross-cultural competence can also improve employee retention, as employees are more likely to stay with an organization that values and respects their cultural differences.\n\n\nIf you are looking to expand your operations globally or fill executive positions internationally, you should work with our global management consultants to find executives who can drive the business forward. By doing so, they can increase their chances of success and build a strong and diverse leadership team that can help drive growth and competitiveness in today's rapidly changing world.\n\n\nTo know more about our services like leadership coaching, professional hiring, management consulting, reach out to us at www.taplowgroup.com\n\n\nThis article is an intellectual property of The Taplow Group.

    "content": "2023 Global Business Outlook Report\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nTuesday, February 7, 2023\n/\nCategories: \nNews\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 3.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nASIA\n \nAUSTRALIA\n \nIn Australia, economic and business conditions continue to show a robust response to market conditions nationally and internationally. The items high on the agenda are climate change driving organisations to introduce response programs, very low unemployment resulting in labour and talent shortages, executive caution with a wariness of how events and conditions may impact business, increasing inflation and interest rates impacting pricing , regional stability in defence and trade, and energy and consumption cost increases. There is resilience of households to high inflation and rising interest rates, against a backdrop of falling housing prices. Household balance sheets overall remain well placed to manage these pressures, supported by strong labour market conditions and the large saving and equity buffers accumulated during the pandemic. Banks remain very well capitalised to continue to support household and business demand for credit. Mineral and resource exports, such as coal, gas, and iron ore, are strengthening the Government's balance sheet. \n \nWe have been fortunate to be less affected than others by the global shocks but nevertheless, we have been significantly affected. In response to the sharp recovery from the pandemic and inflation, monetary policy is rapidly tightening in Australia. Reflecting this tightening, economic growth is forecasted to slow from 3¼ per cent in 2022–23, to 1½ per cent in 2023–24. Strong consumption growth of 6½ per cent in 2022–23 is expected to be temporary, driven primarily by the ongoing rebound in services spending and international travel as the impacts of pandemic activity restrictions continue to wane. Declining household wealth arising from ongoing expected falls in housing prices will further contribute to the slowing of consumption growth.\n \nThe current very tight labour market conditions may gradually ease as economic activity slows. Employment growth is forecast to slow to ¾ per cent in 2023–24 and the unemployment rate is expected to increase to 4.5%, currently it is at 3.4%.\n \nInflation is expected to peak early 2023 before easing gradually by middle of 2024. Electricity and gas prices are expected to directly contribute to inflation with wholesale electricity prices nearly trebling compared to last year prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n \nAt the same time, domestic weather events and supply constraints combined with strong demand in residential construction and consumer goods, are contributing further to generalised price growth.\n \nSources include Australian Bureau of Statistics– December 2022, Opening statement to the Economics Legislation Committee– December 2022, Quarterly Statement by the Council of Financial Regulators – December 2022 \n \nCHINA\n \nThe improvement in China's overall economy could be expected in 2023.\n \nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, the country GDP growth in the fourth quarter in 2022 was at 2.9% year-on-year and a yearly growth at 3.0%, both of which are better than market expectation,\n \nIt is predicted that recovery will become the main keynote of the new year, and economic growth will hopefully converge to a reasonable growth range around 4.8% – 5%. New energy vehicles, smart phones and green smart home appliances will drive the internal power for growth, the fundamental way to restore and expand consumption affected by the pandemic.\n \nStable currency for USD-CNY is the main theme in the coming year\n \nOver the short term, growth and policy enthusiasm are likely to drive USD-CNY lower; however, the interest rate disadvantages could lift USD-CNY. It is predicted that the range of 6.80-7.15 is the new central range for USD-CNY.\n \nThe housing market is to be rescued with great efforts\n \nThe property market will be a key sector to be rescued with great efforts. Proper policy support has been released. It is expected that a more orderly adjustment, not only on demand-supply dynamics, but also on developers’ credit issues has been done. The deleveraging in the property market should be relatively mild, and investors will also find a new and more pragmatic approach to pricing in property-related assets.\n \nDispelling concerns for global investors could be possibly erased\n \nIt is one great sign for global investors that Chinese policymakers have made a clear statement on equal treatment of private enterprises and SOEs. With the normalization of regulation framework, a platform economy will engage global competition. Chinas gradual withdrawal of Covid-related restrictions also means that the economy will be normalizing in the next few months, which will remove one of the biggest uncertainties in the long term. Both services and manufacturing sectors will benefit from the economic recovery.\n \nINDIA\n \nThe year 2022 has been marred by a series of challenging phenomena including inflation, high interest rates, absurd corporate valuations and geopolitical uncertainties led by the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine war, headwinds in China, both on account of the country’s zero covid-tolerance policy and political tension with Taiwan—all of which have led to tighter financial conditions and weakened economic activity across the world. India too hasn’t remained insulated from these macro developments and the country is likely to be impacted further in 2023, albeit to a lesser extent.\n \nIndia’s greatest strength lies in its domestic consumption, amply supported by a young and large working population with disposable incomes and boosting business confidence. The opportunities for growth and investment are ample at present and likely to multiply every passing year.\n \nStating that India’s level of economic activity is closer to the pre-pandemic path, global brokerage firm Credit Suisse expects the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of the country going ahead will be stronger than the current consensus forecast of 6 per cent in the financial year 2023-24 (FY24). The brokerage firm reasons it out in its statement on economic growth as ‘many broad-based high-frequency indicators, including consumption of energy, point to growth being stronger than reported.\n \nAccording to experts, businesses will emphasize on creating work-life integration cultures, nurturing specialty talent, improving skills, and offering flexible work schedules as short-term opportunities increase. Companies are going to be willing to pay more for relevant talents than for legacy capabilities in 2023, according to these trends:\n \n \n \nThe festive-season momentum of increased hiring in retail, e-commerce, and BFSI sectors will likely spill over into 2023. Hiring in the Indian IT sector is likely to rise in the first quarter of 2023 as seven out of 10 companies plan to increase their headcount in the period.\n \n \n \nA similar trend is expected in the services-oriented industries of hospitality, and airline sectors as people continue to travel more to make up for the Covid-time isolation.\n \n \n \nIn addition, key sectors that have indicated their intent to hire are e-commerce, telecommunications, educational services, financial services, retail and logistics. There will also be increased demand for developers of solutions to combat climate change.\n \n \n \nDue to the increasing popularity of virtual job fairs, interviews, tests, and recruitment automation, recruiting will also be done remotely.\n \n \n \nRupee Market 2023\n \nThe Indian rupee is likely to witness heightened volatility in the first six months of the next calendar year on account of global headwinds, experts said. The risks to the rupee include a potential recession and resurgence of COVID. However, the second half of 2023 may see appreciation of the rupee as interest rates may peak and inflation ease.\n \nInternational Trade 2023\n \nIndia's exports may have touched an all-time high of USD 422 billion in 2021-22 but recession in key western markets and geo-political crisis due to the Russia-Ukraine war are expected to impact the growth of the country's outbound shipments in 2023. All the global trade promoting factors like political stability, movement of goods, adequate availability of containers and shipping lines, demand, stable currency and smooth banking systems are in disarray.\n \nTaking note of worsening geopolitical situation, the World Trade Organization (WTO) has projected that the global trade would grow by only one per cent in 2023.\n \nAccording to experts, amid these developments it would be difficult for India to insulate itself from the dark clouds. However, they added that India has managed the growth rate in exports so far and healthy growth in services exports too would help the country's overall outbound shipments in 2023.\n \nNEW ZEALAND \n \nProjections for a slowdown in economic growth have only increased due to the continued rise in borrowing costs. With inflation running red hot, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has been hiking the Official Cash Rate (OCR) at a rapid pace. The OCR has already risen by 400 basis points since October of last year. Those large increases in the OCR have seen a marked downturn in the housing market.\n \nBut as many banks now expect the official cash rate to rise to 5.25% early next year – potentially sending one-year mortgage rates as high as 7.5% – an end to the “cost of living crisis” looks some way off for borrowers at least. Interest rate rises meant 2022 was a year that most investors will want to forget.\n \nNew Zealander’s hold a large amount of their wealth in owner occupied or investor housing, and the fall in prices now in train has taken a sizeable bite out of many households’ net worth. But despite that, overall household spending has continued to trend higher a year after the interest rate tightening cycle began. Crucially, there is no sign that domestic inflation pressures are cooling. In fact, measures of core inflation have continued to push higher. A key reason for that resilience in demand is that around 90% of New Zealand mortgages are actually on fixed rates. Many borrowers locked in very low interest rates in the early stages of the pandemic. That has shielded them – and their spending power – from interest rate increases to date. However, the situation for many New Zealand borrowers is going to become much tougher. Around half of all mortgages will come up for repricing over the coming year, and borrowers will face refixing at rates that are significantly higher than those they are currently on.\n \nHouse prices started to fall at the end of 2021 in response to the rise in fixed term mortgage rates, and they’re now down almost 14% from their peak on average. That still only takes them back to where they were in early 2021, which just goes to show how massive the run-up in prices was in the first place.\n \nDespite this hit to household wealth, consumer spending has been fairly resilient to date. Spending in dollar terms has continued to grow at a solid clip, although increasingly that has reflected rising prices rather than volumes. What has helped is that household incomes have been growing strongly too. At the start of this year, wage growth was the shoe that had yet to drop in this cycle, prompting questions around whether something had changed in the structure of the labour market. That didn’t last long though – wage growth has accelerated sharply in the last few quarters, on some measures reaching its fastest pace in decades. Average wages are now rising fast enough to keep pace with consumer price inflation.\n \nAfter a year of ‘records’ both good and bad, next year will feel like a hangover year for the economy, if economists’ forecasts are on the money.\n \nThe big unknowns remain just how quickly inflation will come down, whether interest rates may already have put the country on a path to recession and of course the outcome, if there is one of Russia’s war on Ukraine.\n \nMost forecasters believe the economy will have grown by somewhere between 2% and 3% this year (2022), after the strong 5.7% bounce-back from Covid lockdowns last year.\n \nAlthough unremarkable in a more normal year, that would be a pretty strong growth rate historically once translated into “GDP per capita”, given the lack of immigration and slow population growth over the period.\n \nBut growth is expected to slow further next year (2023), probably to a snail’s pace, as the impact of interest rate-rises and predicted recessions in Europe and possibly the United States kick in.\n \nBNZ, for example, is forecasting 2.4% growth this year and for that to slow to just 1% next year as aggressive interest rate hikes and a decline in global growth hits home.\n \nInfometrics forecasts that the price for getting inflation back under control in New Zealand and overseas will be two years of “stunted growth” that will mean a couple of uncomfortable years for households.\n \nOfficial unemployment has hovered between 3.2% and 3.3% so far this year (2022).\n \nThat is the lowest since Stats NZ began collating comparable statistics in 1986 and it’s almost certainly the lowest unemployment has been since at least the late 1970s. No-one is expecting that to last, though the current forecasts for the jobs market aren’t dire.\n \nThe RBNZ was assuming in August that unemployment would climb back above 4% next year (2023) and ANZ has it at 4.5% by the end of 2023. BNZ has been forecasting a more modest rise, with unemployment still sitting at only 3.7% at the end of next year.\n \nInflation has been sitting at rates not seen for more than 30 years and was barely budged at 7.2% at the end of September.\n \nRecent falls in the price of oil and other commodities bode better for inflation and BNZ sees it falling away quite sharply to 3% by the end of next year.\n \nAs of early November, the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) was down about 14% on the year and the US S&P Index was down by almost 21%. The retreat extended to bond markets, with investors in New Zealand bonds experiencing average losses of 5% and investors in global bonds about double of that, based on the performance of exchange-trade funds quoted on the NZX between January and November.\n \nTo quote one economist – “We are looking down the barrel of a recession in some parts of the world and New Zealand will not be immune from that. We see the economy going back into its shell more in 2023.”\n \nSources include – Stuff News Digital Platform and Westpac economic Update\n \nAMERICAS\n \nBRAZIL\n \nBrazilian economy has attained major improvements in 2022 and the trend is forecasted to continue in 2023, away from the severe 3-year recession and impact of Covid 19.\n \nBrazilian Inflation in 2022 reached 5.79%, almost half of 10.06% in 2021, and slightly below the 5.00% target for the year, says IBGE, the Governmental Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics. IPCA - the official Ample Consumer Price Index was severely affected by the 11% hike in food & beverage inflation.\n \nIn 2022 , Brazilian GDP achieved a 3.1% growth, according to IPEA, the official Institute for Applied Economic Research, from a revised study of December 15, 2022, versus 2.9% of previous forecast. In terms of GDP worldwide growth, Brazil ranked 54th from a 57th position in 2021.\n \nThe 2022 Brazilian economy ranked 9th worldwide and returned to the top 10 largest economies group. According to IBGE, the Brazilian economy reached 2.544 trillion Brazilian reais. Investment growth forecasted, as a % of GDP, in 2022, will slightly exceed 20%, according to the former Ministry of Economy. This is the largest rate in 8 years. Ideal investment rate, as a way to increase Brazil’s potential growth would have to run between 22% and 25% of GDP, say the Economic Authorities.\n \nContinuous improvement in the unemployment rates\n \nImportant recovery was achieved in the unemployment rates, creation of unskilled and semiskilled jobs improved the Brazilian general labour market in 2022.\n \nAccording to IBGE/PNAD country overall research study ended in Q3 2022, unemployment rate fell 3.8% down to 8.3%, as compared to Q3 2021. This is the lowest rate, since 2014, says IBGE. Current total employed population of Brazil tops 99.7 million.\n \nThe number of “desalentados”/hopeless, discouraged workers (those who constantly looked for jobs over 2 years and have given up doing it) fell from 5.1 million in 2021 to 4.2 million in 2022.\n \n“PROGRAMA AUXÍLIO BRASIL”\n \nThis modest, but very meaningful social program intended to increase income distribution to the very poor continued to be in place during 2022 and has increased in January 2023 as from R$ 400,00, or US$ 72.00/month, to R$ 600,00, or US$ 111.00/month, as a result of both candidates’ promises disputing the presidency of Brazil in the very polarized election of October 2022.\n \nEUROPE\n \nBELGIUM\n \nEconomic growth in Belgium is expected to reach 2.8% in 2022, 0.2% in 2023 and 1.5% in 2024. Following the strong increases in energy prices, high inflation, which is forecasted to reach 10.4% in 2022, 6.2% in 2023 and 3.3% in 2024, is projected to temper the growth of private consumption. The government deficit is projected at 5.2% of GDP in 2022, reflecting the budgetary response to high energy prices. In 2023, the worsening of macroeconomic conditions is projected to widen the budget deficit to 5.8%.\n \nAfter a strong start to 2022, activity weakens\n \nEconomic growth is set to reach 2.8% in 2022, as the easing of COVID-19 related restrictions allowed for further expansion of activity in the first half of the year.\n \nHigh inflation and the decrease in consumer confidence are projected to curb the expansion of household consumption in the second part of the year. Quarterly GDP growth is estimated at -0.1% in 2022-Q3 and is expected to contract further in 2022-Q4. However, further automatic indexations of wages and social benefits are set to support the purchasing power of households moving forward. As indexation kicks in with a lag, this effect is expected to gain strength in 2023 and accelerate in 2024, when inflation is forecast to substantially slow down.\n \nUncertainty, higher cost pressures from input prices and wages are also expected to weigh on business investment. At the same time, the RRF is forecasted to support gross fixed capital formation, in a context of increased needs for the energy transition. Consequently, after a contraction in 2022, investment is projected to recover slowly in 2023 before rebounding more dynamically in 2024.\n \nAfter a strong performance of net exports in 2021, a less favourable external environment is set to weigh on exports in 2022 and 2023. The contribution of net exports to GDP growth is projected to be negative over the forecast horizon. All in all, real GDP growth is expected to slow down to 0.2% in 2023 and rebound to 1.5% in 2024.\n \nSlow-down in the labour market\n \nThe good performance of employment in 2021 has put the Belgian labour market on a strong footing for 2022. However, rising uncertainty and the downturn in economic activity is projected to moderate the performance of the labour market in the second part of 2022 and in 2023. Employment growth is forecasted to reach 1.8% in 2022 and 0.3% in 2023, before regaining some strength in 2024, consistent with economic growth. The unemployment rate is expected to increase from 5.8% in 2022 to 6.4% in 2023 before a small decline to 6.3% in 2024.\n \nInflation on the rise\n \nInflation is forecasted to reach an exceptionally high level of 10.4% in 2022. The sharp increases of wholesale gas and electricity prices have transmitted quickly to retail prices, which are expected to remain high next year. The pass-through of increased costs to core inflation components, including via higher wages, is projected to keep inflation elevated over the forecast horizon. As such, headline inflation is set to reach 6.2% in 2023, before slowing down to 3.3% in 2024 on the back of the gradual fall of energy prices.\n \nThe energy crisis and the economic slowdown add burden on public finances\n \nWhile pandemic-related government measures weighed considerably less on public finances in 2022 than in 2021, the budgetary cost of measures to mitigate the impact of high energy prices keeps the projected budget deficit at high levels in 2022, at 5.2 % of GDP compared to 5.6% of GDP in 2021. The higher expenditure from the automatic indexation of public sector wages and social benefits to rising consumer prices is projected to be only partly offset by the impact of higher wages and purchasing power on the revenue side.\n \nIn 2023, the government deficit is forecasted to increase further to 5.8 %, reflecting the deteriorating macroeconomic landscape, while the cost of energy-related measures is assumed to decline on the back of the announced phasing-out of most of them in the first quarter of 2023. At the same time, the automatic indexation of public sector wages and social benefits, a rising interest rate burden, as well as lower corporate tax revenue due to lower profit margins, are also expected to have a negative impact on the government budget balance.\n \nIn 2024, the government balance is projected to slightly narrow, to 5.1% of GDP as crisis measures are assumed to be withdrawn and the economic outlook is expected to improve. The still high government deficit in 2024 also reflects the growth in non-crisis current expenditure, which is notably due to rising ageing costs and to the budgetary impact of recently adopted permanent measures not offset by compensating measures.\n \nGovernment debt is forecasted to decrease from 109% of GDP in 2021 to 106% in 2022 (due to the high GDP deflator), before increasing to 108% of GDP in 2023 and to 109% 2024, driven by high budget deficits.\n \nSources include: National Bank of Belgium, European Commission, Eurostat\n \n \nFRANCE\n \nIn France, contrasting economic signals point to an industrial decline and therefore a moderate decline in economic activity at the end of 2022, before a gradual rebound, especially in spring 2023.\n \nFrench GDP could decline slightly in the fourth quarter of 2022 (-0.2% expected, after +0.2 in the previous quarter), driven by declining industrial production and sluggish activity in services. Household consumption is expected to contract sharply, due in particular to a sharp decline in energy consumption and a decline in spending on accommodation and food services.\n \nAfter a strong recovery in vehicle purchases in the summer, investment is expected to slow. Foreign trade is expected to underpin activity at the end of the year, with large deliveries of aircraft and ships in particular.\n \nThe beginning of 2023 will continue to be marked by rising of electricity and gas prices, for both businesses and households. Activity should nevertheless rebound very slightly in the first quarter (+0.1% forecast), thanks to the expected rebound in coking and refining after the autumn strikes, and the scheduled restart of several nuclear reactors currently undergoing maintenance. The rebound is expected to be more pronounced in the second quarter (+0.3% forecast) with an acceleration of activity in services.\n \nOverall, annual growth would reach +2.5% in 2022 (after +6.8% in 2021). For 2023, the mid-year GDP growth rate (i.e., the growth that would be obtained assuming that activity in the third and fourth quarters remained at the same level as that forecast for the second quarter) would be positive but modest (+0.4%).\n \nThis forecast scenario assumes that there will be no electricity load shedding this winter, and that the availability of the French nuclear fleet will gradually rebound. In addition to other uncertainties that could affect economic activity (geopolitical developments in Eastern Europe, health situation in China, effectiveness of budgetary support, impact of the current monetary tightening, etc.), there is also a technical uncertainty related to the restarting of French nuclear reactors: their lack of availability would have taken away approximately 0.4 points of GDP in 2022.\n \nInflation (as measured by the consumer price index) is expected to rise to about 7% this winter, then fall back in the spring due to a \"base effect”.\n \nThe evolution of inflation over the next few months depends, among other things, on the evolution of energy price controls and fluctuations in oil prices. The planned increase in regulated gas and electricity tariffs, as well as the end of the discount at the pump, would contribute to raising overall inflation, which would reach +7% over one year at the beginning of 2023. Year-on-year food price inflation would reach about 13%. Starting in the spring, overall inflation could nevertheless fall back due to a \"base effect\" (+5.5% expected in June), with prices continuing to rise month by month but less sharply than a year earlier.\n \nSince 2021, quarter after quarter, employment has been surprisingly strong, more so than activity. The good performance of the employment climate calculated on the basis of business surveys reflects this dynamism. In the third quarter of 2022, salaried employment was 3.6% above its level at the end of 2019, while GDP exceeded its level by 1.1%.\n \nUnder the activity scenario, employment would slow in the coming quarters (+0.2% expected in the fourth quarter of 2022, followed by +0.1% in both the first and second quarters of 2023). Over the forecast horizon, the unemployment rate would remain stable (at 7.3% of the labour force) as the labour force and employment grow at the same pace.\n \nSources include: INSEE – Institut Nationale de la Statistique et des Etudes Economiques.\n \nGERMANY\n \nBusiness and economic outlook for 2023 in Germany are again influenced by global challenges from politics and crises. Significant influencing parameters originate from the country’s ability and willingness to change and from its financial reserves and strengths.\n \nThe expectation in 2023 is again higher inflation than in the pre pandemic years and a light recession of about 0.5% GDP decline which could result in a stagflation.\n \nWar in Ukraine and energy gap fears, particularly gas and electricity, will not just cause problems in some less resilient European countries but will also be new challenges in Germany. Political risks in some developing countries with an effect on trade, geopolitical effects from USA and China, externally and internally, protectionism, may put pressure on global trade also. The world will experience supply chain disruptions again. This effects an export-oriented country like Germany. Large investments in innovations and transitions shall lower the threats.\n \nCapital markets may experience prize corrections repeatedly in some asset classes. New selective answers are required and shall deliver positive effects but on a longer term. Climate issues shall be new chances rather than threats for business overall. In sectors that experienced growth for longer time new leaders maybe required, capable of not only managing an economical sunshine but also navigating through turbulent times. Liquidity of most stake holders including government in Germany shall support getting away economically once more.\n \nLUXEMBOURG\n \nReal GDP growth is projected to slow down to growth rates of 1.5% in 2022, 1% in 2023 and 2.4% in 2024, affected by weaker domestic and external demand, and high uncertainty surrounding consumers and investors’ behaviour. Headline inflation is forecasted to increase to 8.4% this year, before decelerating to 3.8% in 2023 and further to 3.1% in 2024. The new measures to mitigate the impact of high energy prices and the economic slowdown will weigh on the general government balance, especially in 2023. Resulting deficits are projected to increase the general government debt-to-GDP ratio, although still at a low level.\n \nGrowth set to slow down in 2022 and 2023\n \nReal GDP increased by 2.2% in the first half of the year, compared to the same time period in 2021. Nevertheless, growth slowed sharply from 0.7% q-o-q in 2022-Q1 to -0.5% in 2022-Q2, driven by a decline in investment, in particular in construction, and a decrease in private consumption. In 2022 as a whole, GDP is expected to grow at 1.5% y-o-y.\n \nSlowing demand in Luxembourg’s main trading partners and weakening financial outlook are forecasted to weigh on the GDP growth in 2023, estimated to slow down to 1%. This is also reflected in the lower consumer and business confidence. In particular, the construction sector is set to slow down. Nevertheless, investment and private consumption are forecasted to grow at a moderate level, despite rising interest rates expected to weigh on borrowing capacity and demand for mortgages in the country. Private consumption is projected to remain resilient, supported by additional measures introduced by the government in order to tackle high inflation and to maintain households’ purchasing power (‘Solidaritéitspak 2.0’). These measures include the stabilization of electricity prices, limitation of the increase in gas prices to 15%, a reduction of heating oil prices and a 1%-VAT cut until the end of 2023.\n \nPositive prospects for 2024\n \nAlbeit subject to high uncertainty, better prospects are seen for 2024, with an estimated GDP growth rate of 2.4%. The economy is expected to return to its pre-pandemic trend, supported by growing investments and domestic and external demand.\n \nLabour market set to remain resilient\n \nThe labour market is expected to remain resilient, although it is forecasted to weaken slightly because of the economic slowdown. Unemployment is set to reach 4.7% this year, before increasing to 5.1% in 2023. The rise in unemployment is projected to remain subdued due to the high job vacancy rate and positive employment prospects in some sectors such as construction. With growth picking up, the unemployment rate is expected to decrease to 4.9% in 2024.\n \nFiscal support to lower inflation, however core inflation to edge up\n \nHeadline inflation is forecasted to increase to 8.4% in 2022, mainly driven by energy prices. Nevertheless, energy price inflation is expected to moderate from 2022-Q4 until end 2023, easing inflationary pressures, due to the introduction of the ‘Solidaritéitspak 2.0’. Overall, HICP is set to reach 3.8% in 2023, before decreasing to 3.1% in 2024. In turn, core inflation is forecast to rise from 4.7% in 2022 to 5% in 2023, reflecting higher wages and non-industrial goods’ prices. Wage increases are driven by two wage indexations expected to take place in 2023, including the one postponed from July 2022.\n \nSupport measures drive the decline in the general Government balance\n \nIn 2022, the general government balance is expected to record a small deficit of 0.1% following the surplus of 0.8% of GDP in 2021. The government balance is projected to decrease as a result of lower GDP growth and the three government packages to support households and corporates facing higher energy prices. Revenue growth is expected to slow down from the high rate in 2021 but continues to benefit from the strong performance of taxes on products and imports, personal income tax and social contributions. The compensation of employees, social transfers, and subsidies are pushing up expenditure growth in 2022. A main driver of this are the measures to mitigate the economic and social impact of high energy prices amounting to 1.2% of GDP. The high inflation impacts expenditure and revenue mainly via the wage indexation that pushes up social contributions, income tax, compensation of employees and social benefits. In addition, VAT revenues benefit from the increase in prices.\n \nIn 2023, the deficit is set to increase strongly to 1.7% of GDP. This is mainly caused by the additional government support measures of the ‘Solidaritéitspak 2.0’ mitigating the impact of high energy prices for households and corporates, but also due to the slowdown in economic activity and the uncertain prospects for financial markets. Revenue is expected to grow at a more moderate pace, because of the 1%-VAT reduction, which is part of the household income support measures, and because corporate income tax is projected to be impacted by the economic and financial environment. Expenditure is expected to increase, mainly driven by the energy measures (with an estimated budgetary impact of 1.0% of GDP( )), and the compensation of public employees due to the two wage indexations expected for 2023. In addition, public investment is planned to remain above 4% of GDP over the forecast horizon, supporting the green and digital transition, public infrastructure, and housing.\n \nThe general government deficits are forecasted to result in an upward trend of the debt-to-GDP ratio. The positive nominal GDP growth is expected to be offset by new debt issued to finance the deficit of the central government, as the surplus of the social security sector cannot be used for this purpose. Therefore, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase from 24.5% in 2021 to 26.3% in 2024.\n \nSources include National Bank of Luxembourg, European Commission, Eurostat\n \nTHE NETHERLANDS\n \nThe Dutch economy grew strongly in the first half of 2022 on the back of solid export and investment growth. A decrease in households’ real disposable income, tightening financial conditions and the uncertainty caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are, however, expected to lead to a modest contraction of economic activity in the second half of the year. Headwinds are expected to persist in both 2023 and 2024 and annual growth is forecasted to slow down to 0.6% and 1.3% respectively. For 2023, the authorities have announced a package of measures to mitigate the impact of high energy prices, which is expected to support domestic demand and prevent a more substantial slowdown in GDP growth. The measures taken by the government are forecasted to increase the budget deficit to 4.0% of GDP in 2023. With the expiry of the support measures at end of 2023, the deficit is set to decrease to 3.1% of GDP in 2024.\n \nA strong economy at a turning point\n \nFollowing strong annual GDP growth in 2021, the Dutch economy continued to grow rapidly in the first half of the year, driven by substantial investment growth and a large contribution from net trade. However, the surging inflation, in part caused by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, is starting to weigh on the Dutch economy. With price increases far exceeding wage growth, households are seeing their real disposable income decrease, which is forecasted to lead to a small contraction in consumer spending in the second half of 2022. At the same time, tightening financial conditions, labour shortages and the increased uncertainty about the economic outlook are expected to lead to a decline in investment activity. The Dutch economy is forecast to stagnate in the third quarter and to contract modestly in the fourth quarter. Overall, annual GDP growth in 2022 is forecasted at 4.6%.\n \nEconomic conditions in 2023 remain challenging\n \nWith an expected weak external environment, further tightening of financial conditions and high international energy prices, economic conditions in 2023 would remain challenging. As a result, both export and business investment growth are set to be subdued throughout 2023. To alleviate the impact of high inflation on households’ budgets, the authorities have announced a set of support measures, which are expected to prevent a further slowdown in private consumption growth. Government consumption and investment are projected to grow robustly and contribute substantially to the forecast annual GDP growth of 0.6%.\n \nReal disposable income growth is expected to remain limited in 2024 as the support measures put in place by the authorities are set to expire by end-2023. Investment growth is forecasted to pick up slightly and net trade to contribute positively to growth. Uncertainty is, however, expected to remain high and GDP is forecasted to grow moderately in 2024 at 1.3%.\n \nA tight labour market\n \nThe Dutch labour market remains tight, though unemployment has been gradually picking up in recent months. With global demand weakening, the unemployment rate is forecasted to pick up further, from 3.7% in 2022 to 4.3% in 2023 and 4.3% in 2024. Overall, the forecast for unemployment rates in 2023 and 2024 remain low in historical perspective. Nominal wage growth is on a clear upward trend, reflecting both the tight labour market and the high inflation, and is expected to increase to 4.5% in 2023.\n \nSurging inflation\n \nThe increased uncertainty regarding the supply of gas has led to surging energy prices in recent months. In addition, price pressures have broadened, with core inflation continuing to pick up. As result of this, HICP inflation reached 17.1% in September and 16.8% in October, among the highest in the euro area. Energy prices are expected to remain elevated in the remainder of 2022 and 2023 before declining in 2024. However, the Dutch authorities have announced a price cap on electricity and gas prices, which will apply until end-2023. The price cap is forecasted to substantially lower annual inflation in 2023 to 4.2%, down from 11.6% in 2022. Core inflation is set to peak in the beginning of 2023 and gradually decline thereafter. Headline annual inflation is projected to decrease to 3.9% in 2024, with the planned expiry of the price cap on energy preventing a sharper decline in headline inflation.\n \nSupport measures drive up deficit in 2023\n \nIn 2022, the deficit is forecasted to decrease to 1.1% of GDP, driven by higher revenues from income taxes and Dutch gas fields, while spending on COVID-19 related measures is projected to decrease.\n \nFor 2023, the government announced a package of both temporary and structural support measures to mitigate the impact of high energy prices on both households and companies. This package includes a price cap on electricity and gas, the extension of a reduction in the excise duty on fuel and the increase of an energy compensation benefit scheme for lower-income households until end 2023. Besides these temporary interventions, different structural measures, such as the rise of the minimum wage by 10% and a decrease in taxes on labor income are planned to enter into effect in 2023. Based on the Government’s estimates, the fiscal cost of the package is expected to be between EUR 20 billion and EUR 30 billion (some 2 - 3% of GDP), with the cost of the price cap depending on how energy prices develop.\n \nPartly as a result of this large expansionary package, the Government deficit is forecasted to increase to 4.0% in 2023. As the temporary measures expire at the end of 2023, the deficit is projected to drop slightly to 3.1% in 2024.\n \nGovernment debt is projected to increase from 50.3% of GDP in 2022 to 52.4% in 2023 and 53.2% in 2024.\n \nSources include: National Bank of The Netherlands, European Commission, Eurostat\n \nNORWAY\n \nThe Norwegian economy has recovered rapidly following the pandemic. The labour market is now very tight, wage growth appears to be on the rise and inflation has reached its highest levels in decades. Tighter economic policy is now necessary.\n \nIn the National Budget the government projects consumer price inflation at 4.8 per cent in 2022 and 2.8 per cent in 2023. Both forecasts are higher than projected in the Revised National Budget from May. Economic growth appears to be decelerating faster than previously anticipated, both in Norway and abroad. The growth forecast for the non-oil economy (GDP for mainland Norway) is 2.9% in 2022, 1.7% in 2023 and 2.0% in 2024. This is somewhat lower than was projected in the Revised National Budget.\n \nUnemployment is nevertheless expected to remain low. It is likely that employers will continue to experience problems in recruiting within several professions. Registered unemployment is projected to be 1.7% of the labour force in both 2022 and 2023, a decrease from 3.1% in 2021.\n \nThe growth in house prices has slowed in recent months, after being high for several years. Statistics Norway’s house price index shows that house prices in the second quarter of 2022 this year were 19.5% higher than the corresponding quarter two years earlier.\n \nReal Estate Norway’s monthly house price index shows weak growth throughout the summer but that the growth rate in August was at the same level as in 2021. The forecasts estimate that house prices will increase by 5.7% in 2022, and then fall by 2.5% in both 2023 and 2024.\n \nSources includes National Statistical Institute of Norway and Norwegian Government.\n \nSPAIN\n \nEconomic slowdown\n \nThe year 2023 will bring a significant slowdown in the growth rate of the Spanish economy - which will increase by 1.1% - and a mild improvement in the evolution of prices, which could be around 4% in June next. This is the opinion of experts and executives of the Economic and Business Consensus of PwC, corresponding to the fourth quarter of the year.\n \nIn this way, Spain will not recover in 2023 the gross domestic product it had before the pandemic. As a result, the estimates of these experts on the average growth of activity are slightly lowered for 2022 - from 4% to 3.9% - and significantly for 2023 - from 3% to 1.1% -.\n \nThe slowdown in economic activity will be mainly due to the fall in demand from families, both consumption and, especially, the purchase of housing. In fact, they anticipate that consumption will decrease in the coming months, and that the same will happen with housing purchases, probably due to the increase in interest rates and the increase in mortgages.\n \nAs for companies in the coming months, a decrease in productive investment and job creation is expected. However, their better relative situation compared to that of families is based on the evolution of exports that will continue stable, at least, until mid-2023. A situation that is being benefited by the depreciation of the euro against the dollar.\n \nLess tensions in prices\n \nInflationary tensions are beginning to ease. An improvement in the inflation forecast for 2023 is estimated, which places the growth of prices in June 2023 at 4%.\n \nHowever, most of the experts, executives, and businesspeople interviewed consider that it is still too soon to know if the increase in inflation in our country will acquire a more structural character. And when asked about which are the factors that most concern them for the future evolution of the CPI, they highlight, first, the increase in energy prices and, second, the increase in labour costs.\n \nBeing aware that Spain is still lagging behind in the recovery of GDP, our economy could show greater resilience than the Eurozone due to a number of factors. Among them are the less impact of the energy shock compared to other European countries, a less tense real estate market and the resilience of the labour market.\n \nSWEDEN\n \nThe Swedish economy is set to contract mildly in 2023 as high inflation, rising household debt service and uncertainty weigh on household consumption and investment. Wage pressures are projected to remain contained, in line with the rise in unemployment. This, along with falling commodity and freight prices and easing supply bottlenecks is expected to contribute to the decrease of inflation over the forecast horizon, supporting a gradual recovery as of the second half of 2023. The general government balance is projected to show a slight surplus.\n \nIn view of labour shortages in a wide range of sectors, the labour market is set to remain relatively robust in the face of the projected slowdown. Nevertheless, the unemployment rate is set to rise to just below 8% in 2024 in a delayed response to the expected slowdown.\n \nUK\n \nThe UK economy recovered from the COVID-19 shock thanks to emergency support measures protecting jobs and incomes and a rapid vaccine rollout but is slowing amid persisting supply shortages and rising inﬂation. Fiscal policy has to balance gradual tightening with providing well-targeted temporary support to households who are vulnerable to rising costs of living, supporting growth and addressing signiﬁcant investment needs.\n \nAccelerating progress towards net zero is fundamental to enhance energy security. The United Kingdom is among world leaders in reducing domestic greenhouse gas emissions, has a strong institutional framework and a broad political consensus supporting the target to reduce net emissions to zero by 2050.\n \nThe UK economy will shrink by 1.3% in 2023, amidst a relatively shallow but protracted recession. This will be followed by a partial recovery in 2024, which could see GDP rise by 0.2%.\n \nElevated inflation and rising interest rates will continue to put pressure on households’ living standards. By the end of Q3 2022 household consumption has already fallen by 0.6% on a per capita basis and is projected to fall by a further 3.4% by mid-2024. While a fall in savings or higher borrowing could support consumption to some degree, persistently low levels of consumer confidence could lead to higher levels of precautionary savings, the report tells.\n \nCompanies’ margins and investment are negatively affected by rising interest rates and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties, slowing global growth over the medium term. Expect overall investment to shrink by 0.7% in 2023, before recovering by 0.2% in the following year. As the economic environment deteriorates, a higher number of company insolvencies are expected.\n \nHigh inflation, a squeeze on corporate profits and the ensuing cost of living crisis are a direct result of the imbalance caused by the lockdowns. Russia’s war on Ukraine further only added to inflation as imports of Russian gas were reduced leading to a surge in energy prices. Food prices also rose as Ukraine’s exports were impacted. Along with Russia, it supplies half the world’s exports of vegetable oils.\n \nHowever, the unemployment rate remains low at 3.7%, close to the lowest level in five decades. What’s more, businesses are still desperate for staff, and this is resulting in labour market tightness, which is driving higher earnings . Deutsche Bank says, “The UK’s labour supply shock has been nothing short of historic”.\n \nIt adds “In the last 12 labour market reports, AWE Regular Pay has outshot consensus expectations 10 times.”, where AWE refers to average weekly earnings. Further, wages have seen “the strongest growth outside of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic period” according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS).\n \nSources include: OECD, KPMG, Deutsch Bank and UK Government. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2751)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

More than not, organizations look up to their leadership to manage change effectively. But what happens when a leader leaves suddenly or doesn’t have the skill set or the bandwidth to look at something that demands immediate attention. That’s where interim managers come into the picture. Interim managers are an effective alternative to a full time C-suite hire. These are highly motivated and agile individuals who come into an organization, solve a mission-critical problem, and then hop onto their next endeavors. It is a win-win for both – the organization and the interim executive do not have any long-term obligation toward each other, and they mutually benefit each other during the short stint of stay. Our executive interim management consultants will ensure that you hire the best of the best, people who can deliver from day one.\n\n\n \n\n\nTo reap the benefits of interim management services let us understand the benefits they bring to the table –\n\n\n\n\nExperience\n\n\nInterim managers bring along a host of experiences with them. Executives in our network have decades of industry experience and have served multiple C-suite roles during their careers. Now, they want to share their experience with organizations and help them build a product, come out of a financial crisis, manage a merger, and fix a troubled organization. You would agree that there is no substitute for experience and interim executives are the front-runners of industry experience.\n\n\n\n\nCross industry expertise\n\n\nHeard of the rolling stone gathering no moss? You can visualize in real-life with interim executives. These people keep upgrading and updating themselves with the latest technology, skills, and thinking. They do not believe in institutional blind spots and keep hopping from one industry to another, bringing along the best practices and experience. These executives always display a hunger for continuous learning and self-improvement.\n\n\n\n\nOutcome-oriented\n\n\nInterim executives are always goal oriented. They do not believe in delivering fancy presentations and achieving any results. They talk less, show more, and are always driven by results. When you hire these executives, you are bringing in results, positive outcomes, and growth by default. ‘Laser-focused’, and ‘result-driven’ are some of the phrases that we associate with interim executives.\n\n\n\n\nEmpowering others\n\n\nIn the world of business, there is no one-man show. A true leader knows how to empower his/her team and enhance productivity. That’s true for interim leaders as well. They motivate their fellow associates and empower them to become highly productive individuals. That’s how they transform the entire organization and its workforce.\n\n\n\n\nSustainability\n\n\nInterim and sustainability! Sounds like an oxymoron, isn’t it? But that’s what interim executives do. They do not build organizations dependent on them – rather they build self-sustaining systems that can run effectively in their absence as well. They plan for the long-term benefit of the organization. They set in place good leadership, excellent workplace culture, and processes that will result generate success in the future.\n\n\n \n\n\nIf you are looking to transform your organizational leadership, and you want to make that change quick and effective then connect with us today. Our interim executive management consultants will ensure that your company gets the best leadership for a better tomorrow.

Let us eliminate the myth – automation is not replacing human beings; it is making things simpler and creating room for humans to operate more efficiently. The same goes for operations at an \nexecutive search consultant firm\n. Artificial intelligence and next-gen technologies assists replace old and inefficient systems and devices, with modern processes that not only enhance productivity but also enhance success.\n\n\n \n\n\nHere's how automation can enhance recruitment within a executive search firm:\n\n\nManaging candidate database\n\n\nManual entry gives room for duplicates, redundant information, errors, and mistakes. Automation can replace manual efforts and easily extract information from online resources, resumes, documents, and update records without any manual intervention. Automation can replace manual notifications and reminders and streamline a lot of the workflow processes. On one hand, this helps you maintain a well-structured database and on the other it lets you search and track candidates smoothly.\n\n\n \n\n\nAutomate interview schedules and update calendars\n\n\nEveryone seems busy and it is difficult to get the candidate and the interview team to a common slot! You can now automate the process and let technology scan individual calendars and find a common slot and schedule an interview. You get automatic notifications, ensuring that no party misses the call. At the same time, it will help you keep track of all the interviews and their statuses for future reference.\n\n\n \n\n\nAutomate assessment tracking and evaluation\n\n\nA lot of times, certain candidate assessments require routine or similar evaluations where no human cognitive efforts are needed. It can be a set of questions answered and anyone can match it with a given set of solutions. Give it to an automation tool to do it! You not only save time and effort but complete more tasks more efficiently\n. \n\n\n \n\n\nAutomate report creation\n\n\nOne thing a lot of employees in an \nexecutive search\n firm might dread – extracting data and creating daily/weekly/monthly reports. Bring in automation to enhance the process. It will not only create these reports but also share them with the respective stakeholders. By now, you must have realized that automation is not replacing any human skill. It is just making lives simpler for  executives and consultants so that they can completely focus on their \nexecutive search services\n.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group we not only help you source the best-fit for your organization’s leadership, through our executive search consultants but also train and develop them to hone their skills.

Recent research suggests that there may be a neurological basis for procrastination, with some people being more susceptible to it than others. This research suggests that for some people, procrastination may be a way of avoiding negative emotions, such as anxiety or guilt.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is procrastination?\n\r\nProcrastination is a habit of delaying work or tasks that need to be done. It can be a problem because it can lead to lower productivity and stress. Procrastination is often caused by a fear of failure or feeling overwhelmed. There are strategies that can help overcome procrastination, including setting goals, breaking tasks into smaller pieces, and focusing on positive motivation.\n\n\n\n\nWhy do people procrastinate?\n\r\nThere are many different causes of procrastination. Some people procrastinate because they are perfectionists, and they want everything to be perfect before they start working on it. Others do it because they are afraid of failure, and they don’t want to do anything that might not be perfect. Some people procrastinate because they are easily distracted, and they get side-tracked easily. Others procrastinate because they don’t know how to start, or they don’t know where to start. And finally, some people procrastinate because they are just lazy and they don’t want to do anything.\n\n\n\n\nConsequences of procrastination\n\r\nProcrastination can have a range of negative consequences, both in the short-term and long-term. In the short-term, people may feel rushed, stressed, and overwhelmed, which can lead to poor decision-making and decreased productivity. In the long-term, chronic procrastination can have a negative impact on mental health, relationships, and career prospects.\n\n\n\n\nHow to overcome procrastination\n\r\nThere are many things that can be done to overcome procrastination. One of the most important is to set realistic goals. If you know you can't finish a project in a day, don't set yourself up for failure by trying to do it all in one day. break the project down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and give yourself a timeline for completing them.\n\n\n\r\nIt's also important to be organized. have a designated space for your work, and make sure all of your materials are within reach. If you have to get up and search for something every time you want to work on a project, you're going to be less likely to get anything done.\n\r\nFinally, make sure you take breaks. It's important to give yourself time to relax and rejuvenate, or you'll eventually burn out. Take a walk, watch a movie, or read a book. Just make sure that when you're done taking a break, you're ready to get back to work.\n\n\n\r\nThere is a technique known as the Pomodoro Technique. It is a time management method that is based on 25-minute stretches of focused work, broken by five-minute breaks. After four consecutive work intervals, you take a longer break, typically 15 to 30 minutes. Each work interval is called a pomodoro, the Italian word for tomato.\n\n\n\r\nSo, get ready to beat procrastination and become more productive!\n\n\nThis article is an intellectual property of The Taplow Group.

But today most organizations engage an executive search firm to augment their \nhuman capital search\n.\n\n\n\r\nThere is no exaggerating the fact that hiring the right people at the right time is one of the most challenging endeavors for any company. However, even with existing talent gaps, some businesses may hesitate to start hiring due to lack of the resources necessary for securing top talent.

It can be difficult to achieve a balance that works for everyone, as everyone's needs, and preferences are different. However, there are a few things that can help to achieve a better work-life balance.\n\n\nThere is no doubt that the ability to work from anywhere offers a better work-life balance for many people. For example, being able to take work calls while taking a break at the park or working on a project from home in the evening can help reduce stress and make it easier to balance work and personal responsibilities.\n\n\nHowever, there are also some potential downsides to remote work, such as feeling isolated or not having the same level of supervision. Perhaps the biggest one is that it can be hard to stay motivated and focused when you're not in an office environment. It's also more difficult to build strong relationships with co-workers when you're not working face-to-face. Additionally, remote workers can often feel isolated and disconnected from their teams.\n\n\nOne important thing to keep in mind is that it is important to set boundaries. It is easy to get consumed by work, but it is important to set time aside for other activities, such as spending time with family and friends, or taking time for yourself. It is also important to be organized and to plan ahead. This can help to avoid feeling overwhelmed and stressed.\n\n\nFinally, it is important to communicate with your boss and co-workers. If you need to take time off for personal reasons, let them know. This will help to avoid any misunderstandings. By keeping these things in mind, it is possible to achieve a better work-life balance.\n\n\nThis article is an intellectual property of The Taplow Group.

To find the right people, you need to build a talent pipeline, and to build that you need the best \nglobal executive search services\n as your partners.\n \nBuilding a talent pipeline does not mean accumulating resumes – it means that you go beyond the sourcing candidates and understand the entire landscape thoroughly – something our expert executive search consultant will help you with. It is a strategy to nurture talent, keep engaging with them and build long-term relationships. In short, you save time and resources when you have a structured talent pipeline.\n \nIf you are still not convinced, let us take a look at the top reasons why your organization should build a talent pipeline –\n \nManage attrition rates\n \nRushed acceptance of job offers results in dissatisfaction and hence attritions. However, that is not the case for candidates in your talent pipeline. Here you have a prior relationship with candidates, and they are fully aware of your organization, the role that they are stepping into, and the culture they are going into. With a complete understanding of the role and the organizations, individuals find higher job satisfaction resulting in higher retention rates.\n \nSave time and resources\n \nResearch indicates that roles in tech fields like engineering take an average of 49 days while non-tech fields like finance and marketing take 46 and 40 days to recruit a new hire. With a talent pipeline, you save time and resources for your organization. You can use the saved time and resources to enhance your recruitment strategy and enrich the talent pipeline. Having a talent pool means you are already two steps ahead and no doubt it reduces time and effort in hiring new talents.\n \nQuality over quantity\n \nTo hire the best people, you need to stop spamming and cold-calling candidates in the market. In the pipeline model, it is a relationship based and the relation is nurtured over time. This means that the people you hire will give you access to their network and refer their trusted friends. This means you have employees with amazing skills, who can be trusted and will align easily with your organization and its processes.\n \nEnhanced experience\n \nThe net result is that you create a better experience for the candidates. This has a positive impact on your brand image and will go a long way in establishing your credibility in the market. Having a talent pipeline is like a two-way channel, a win-win situation for both. However, you need to put in the effort, have patience, and partner with the best \nglobal executive search\n services\n firm to build an efficient talent pipeline.\n \nTo know more about our services like leadership coaching, professional hiring, management consulting, reach out to us at www.taplowgroup.com\n \nThis article is an intellectual property of The Taplow Group.

That is why leadership training programs are so important. Our \nCEO training program\n helps organizations to cultivate leaders who are able to make smart decisions and lead their organization to success.\n\n\nWhy Leadership Training Programs are Important?\n\n\nLeadership training programs are important because they help equip individuals with the skills they need to be effective leaders. Such programs can provide participants with a better understanding of themselves and their own strengths and weaknesses, as well as teaching them how to better manage and motivate others. They can also help leaders learn how to make better decisions and solve problems. In short, leadership training programs can help individuals become more effective leaders and contribute to the success of their organizations.\n\n\nAll businesses, regardless of size or industry, need effective leaders. Yet, many companies do not provide leadership training for their employees. This can be a costly mistake.\n\n\nLeadership training is essential for two reasons. First, it helps employees develop the skills they need to be effective leaders. Second, it provides employees with the knowledge and understanding necessary to work effectively with their leaders.\n\n\nLeadership training should be an ongoing process, not a one-time event. Employees should be given the opportunity to learn and grow throughout their careers. Leaders should also be given the opportunity to improve their skills.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, a leading \nLeadership Development Management Services Firm\n, we believe that leadership training is a valuable investment for any company. It can help employees reach their full potential and contribute to the success of the organization.\n\n\nThe benefits of leadership training\n\n\nLeadership training is an important investment for any organization. It can help employees develop the skills they need to lead their teams and contribute to the organization's success. There are many benefits of leadership training, including:\n\n\n• Improved Communication and Problem-Solving Skills\n\n\n• Enhanced Teamwork and Collaboration\n\n\n• Improved Decision-Making Skills\n\n\n• Better Understanding of Company Goals and Objectives\n\n\n• Increased Motivation and Productivity\n\n\nLeadership training can also help employees build their personal brands and advance their careers. It can provide them with the skills and knowledge they need to take on new challenges and responsibilities.\n\n\nOrganizations that invest in leadership training are more likely to have a motivated, productive and successful workforce.\n\n\nThe role of leadership training\n\n\nA good leader is someone who is able to motivate and lead a team to success. This is not an innate ability but rather one that can be learned with the right training. Leaders need to be able to identify goals and motivate team members to achieve these goals. They also need to be able to communicate effectively, handle difficult situations, and make timely decisions. Leadership training can help leaders learn these skills and become more effective in their roles.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group help you source the best-fit for your organization’s leadership through our\n \nCEO search services\n.\n To know more about our services like leadership coaching, professional hiring, management consulting, reach out to us at www.taplowgroup.com\n\n\nThis article is an intellectual property of The Taplow Group.

With the growth of the hybrid work environment, employees \n \nare working from home, in co-working spaces, and in other remote locations. This change has created a need for a new way of managing employees. Performance management in the hybrid work environment must be designed to meet the needs of this new type of workforce.\n \nPerformance management is the process of managing and improving employee productivity and performance. It involves setting goals, measuring progress, providing feedback, and taking corrective action as needed.\n \nPerformance management is important for both employees and managers. For employees, it can help them to set and achieve goals, and to improve their skills and knowledge. For managers, it can help them to ensure that employees are meeting expectations and are productive and effective.\n \nIt is an important part of every organization and should be given the attention it deserves.\n \nThere are a few key steps to successfully implementing performance management in a hybrid work environment. The first is to make sure that the performance management system is aligned with the company's overall strategy. The second is to ensure that the system is easy to use and that employees are familiar with it. The third is to make sure that managers are properly trained in how to use the system and how to provide feedback. The fourth is to track and analyze the data to ensure that the system is effective.

If you have made the right investments in your human capital via human capital search, then you are on the right track, and success and profitability will automatically follow.\n\r\n \n\n\nBut the question is – how to invest wisely in\n \n human capital development?\n\n\n\n\n#1 Understand what is human capital\n \n\r\nBefore that – what is human capital? Simply put, it is quantifying the value that an employee brings in through his/her skills and competencies. When you put together the skills of all your employees, you see the intrinsic value of your organization. That’s your human capital – the economic quantification of the skills possessed by all your employees. Now investing in your human capital – developing skills, bringing in more employee engagement and welfare is in essence investing in your own company itself. What’s the RoI – higher productivity and greater profitability?\n\n\n\n\n#2 Make your employees contemporary\n\r\nIf your industry is tech-driven and technology is rapidly upgrading itself, then you need to invest in your employees to upskill themselves. Make sure you choose certifications or programs that are relevant to your company as well for the broader industry. This will make them stay aligned with the changing industry dynamics and also help your organization steer in the right direction.\n\n\n\n\n#3 Make their lives simpler\n\r\nThis does not mean reducing the workload – this means creating harmony. Ensure that your employees enjoy optimal work-life balance. Invest in developing the career of your employees, help them aspire and work on their goals, and also help them with benefits like insurance and medical facilities. These will make them feel valued and in turn, they will enhance their performance at work. When you invest in your employees, then invest back in your company.\n\n\n\n\n#4 Invest in the latest tools and equipment\n\r\nInvesting in your human capital does not mean that you only invest in them. It also implies that you invest in the assets and tools that are being used by your employees. It can range from a new couch to the latest software to ensuring that you have a pleasant cafeteria and sufficient arrangements for recreation and entertainment. Invest in your office infrastructure so that your employees love to come to work and perform to their best. If you have obsolete machinery, legacy systems, and no recreational measures, then the performance of your employees will automatically drop, and they will lose motivation.\n\n\n\n\n#5 engage a human capital development firm to refine your human capital search\n\r\nFinally, partner with the experts who can do it all for you. Professional \n human capital services\n will help you identify the gaps and formulate a strategy where you can invest and reap benefits in the best manner. These experts are highly experienced professionals with in-depth knowledge of your industry. Human capital development should be a priority for all organizations and to achieve the best results.\n\n\n\r\nAt The Taplow Group we not only help you source the best-fit for your organization’s leadership through our executive search consultants but also train and develop them to hone their skills.

What works for one generation may not work for another. In order to be successful, it's important to understand the different generations and what motivates them.\n\r\nThe workforce is always changing. As new generations enter the workforce, they bring with them different attitudes, values, and ways of working. This can often lead to conflict in the workplace, as older generations often struggle to understand the young people, and the young people struggle to understand the older generations.\n\n\n\r\nManaging generational differences can be a difficult task, but it is important for the success of the business. In order to manage these differences, it is important to understand the different generations and their motivations.\n\r\nThe oldest generation, often referred to as the \"traditionalists,\" grew up in a time when work was more structured and hierarchical. They are often loyal to their company and believe in working hard for the sake of the company. The \"baby boomers\" are the second oldest generation. They are often motivated by money and status and are known for their work ethic.\n\n\n\r\nThe \"generation x\" are the children of the baby boomers. They are often independent and skeptical, and they place a high value on work/life balance. The \"millennials\" are the youngest generation, and they are often characterized by their high level of technological literacy. They are often team-oriented and want to feel like they are making a difference.\n\n\n\n\nEach generation has its own strengths and weaknesses, and it is important to understand these when managing a team. You need to be able to adapt to the different needs and motivations of each generation. If you can do that, you'll be able to create a more harmonious and productive workplace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (1521)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

It is often difficult to identify situations that demand \nexecutive interim management\n services\n.\n\n\nWhen do you need interim management services?\n\n\nHere are five such situations where you should look for interim management services. One common thing among all these situations is that they happen abruptly, and they need speedy resolutions.\n\n\nLeadership vacancy without a succession plan\n\n\nAll organizations plan for their next set of leaders but what do you do if someone meets with an unfortunate event or resigns suddenly? Such leadership vacuums are the most problematic. It becomes difficult for organizations to find a successor, both internally as well as from outside. This is where an interim executive leader can hold the reins and bring stability. Typically, such appointments last longer than other interim managers as the person has to stabilize the entire organization, and potentially it opens opportunities to become a long-term CEO.\n\n\nManaging a financial crisis\n\n\nWhen you are facing a financial downfall and you are at a loss for strategies, then you need handholding from a competent interim manager. The role of this leader is very critical since they have to bring the company out of bankruptcy and put it back on the profitability track. Sometimes, these leaders are also called Chief Restructuring Officers (CROs), as they try to put things together to bring profitability to the company. It is very difficult to hire someone who can turn around the tables in a minimum time and hence you should partner with \nexecutive interim management\n services\n to hire the best.\n\n\nRe-building trust\n\n\nA company is also a living entity, and it relies on the trust of its managing directors, investors, suppliers, and customers. Sometimes, due to bad performance or negative market rumors, you might lose credibility and hence the confidence of your stakeholders. Now an interim manager comes into the picture and helps you rebuild that confidence and trust. The interim manager brings in an impartial view and works with the team to align with the vision and mission of the organization.\n\n\nBringing stability during and after M&A\n\n\nM&A activities are very common as business houses build on an inorganic pathway. When an organization goes through a merger or acquisition, it brings in a lot of stress for the leadership and the employees. Sometimes C-suite leaders resign, the entire investor support falls, or even it leads to financial downfall. To keep things stable and hold the reigns steady, you need a sharp interim manager who can manage the M&A processes, keep the team intact, and bring stability to the entire organization.\n\n\nManage special requirements\n\n\nNew product launches and geographic expansions are some examples where you might need niche/localized skills that are not present within the leadership. An interim manager can bring in this expertise and manage the projects smoothly. They would act like local guides who are extremely knowledgeable about their domain and can manage everything in a successful manner.\n\n\nTough times call for tough people; our \ninterim executive management\n services\n are known for the leaders we provide and the results that follow!

On the one hand, moonlighting can provide extra income, which can be helpful in meeting financial obligations. On the other hand, moonlighting can be risky, and can lead to burnout if too much time is devoted to extra work.\nThe Pros of Moonlighting\n \nThere are several benefits to moonlighting, whether it's taking on a part-time job in addition to your full-time career or starting a business on the side. Here are some of the top reasons to consider moonlighting:\n \n1. Increased income. One of the most obvious benefits of moonlighting is that it can help you make more money. If you're struggling to make ends meet, taking on a part-time job or starting a side business can help you bring in more revenue.\n \n2. Increased job security. If you're worried about losing your job, moonlighting can help you feel more secure. By having a side hustle, you'll have more ways to make money if you lose your primary source of income.\n \n3. Increased skills and experience. When you moonlight, you have the opportunity to learn new skills and gain experience in different areas. This can be a great way to expand your resume and make yourself more marketable for future jobs.\n \n4. Increased flexibility. With a side business or job, you have more flexibility to work around your schedule. This can be helpful if you need to balance work with family or other commitments.\n \n5. Increased creativity. Working on something outside of your day-to-day job can help you be more creative and come up with new ideas. This can be helpful in your primary job or in your business ventures.\n \nThere are many benefits to moonlighting, so if you're thinking about doing it, go for it!\n \nThe Cons of Moonlighting\n \nThere are several disadvantages to moonlighting. First, it can be difficult to balance your time between your job and your additional work. If you're not careful, you may find yourself overworked and stressed out. Additionally, moonlighting can lead to job burnout. If you're working a lot of hours on your side job, you may not have the energy or enthusiasm to give your full effort at your main job. Finally, moonlighting can also lead to conflicts with your employer. If you're doing work on the side that's in competition with your employer, you may find yourself in trouble.\n \nWhat to Watch Out For When Moonlighting\n \nThere are a few things to watch out for when moonlighting. First, make sure you are not violating any employment agreements you have with your primary employer. Second, be aware of any conflicts of interest that may arise. For example, if you are working for a competing company, you may not be able to disclose confidential information you learn at your other job. Finally, be careful not to over-commit yourself. It can be tough to balance two jobs, so make sure you are able to handle the extra work.\n \nThis article is an intellectual property of The Taplow Group.

Recent research indicates that companies with more women in top executive positions delivered better financial results than those with fewer women in those roles. This is likely due to the fact that women leaders often bring different perspectives and approaches to problem solving. Developing more women leaders with our \n CEO Training Program\n can help your organization achieve its goals and thrive in the increasingly competitive business environment.\n\n\n\n\nHow can CEO Search Services help you to hire more women leaders?\n\n\n\r\nThe changing demographics of the workforce call for a more diverse set of leaders. As our workforce becomes more diverse, so too must our leaders. Diverse leaders can better understand and represent the needs of a diverse workforce.\n\n\n\r\nLeaders from diverse backgrounds can provide new perspectives and innovative solutions to problems. They can also help to create a more inclusive environment in which everyone can feel comfortable and respected.\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping women leaders can help to improve organizational performance\n\n\n\r\nIn recent years, there has been a rise in the number of studies examining the relationship between gender diversity and organizational performance. This growing body of research has found that organizations with more women in leadership positions tend to perform better than those with fewer women in leadership. This suggests that developing women leaders can help to improve organizational performance.\n\n\n\r\nThere are a number of reasons why having more women in leadership positions can lead to better organizational performance. First, having a more gender diverse leadership team can help to ensure that the voices of all employees are heard. This can lead to better decision-making and a more inclusive workplace. Second, women leaders often bring different skills and perspectives to the table, which can help organizations to become more innovative and adaptable. Third, women leaders can help to create a more positive work environment, which can improve employee satisfaction and motivation. Finally, having more women in leadership can help to shatter the glass ceiling and improve opportunities for women in the workplace.\n\n\n\r\nWhile there is evidence that developing women leaders can lead to better organizational performance, there are also a number of challenges that organizations face in promoting and developing women leaders. For example, women often face barriers such as gender bias and the \"glass ceiling\" that limit their advancement into leadership positions. Organizations may also have trouble attracting and retaining women leaders, as they often face greater work-life balance challenges than men. Our \n CEO Certification program\n can help your organization overcome this challenge by building resilient women leaders.\n\r\nDespite these challenges, there is a growing consensus that developing women leaders is essential for creating a more equitable and successful workplace. Organizations that are committed to promoting diversity and inclusion should make the development of women leaders a priority.\n\n\n\n\nWomen leaders can inspire other women and girls to pursue leadership roles.\n\n\n\r\nWomen leaders can be powerful role models and sources of inspiration for other women and girls who are interested in pursuing leadership roles. When women see other women in leadership positions, it can increase their confidence and motivation to pursue similar goals. Female leaders can also help to break down gender stereotypes and encourage other women to be ambitious and outspoken. Girls who are exposed to powerful female leaders are more likely to believe that they can achieve anything they want in life. By supporting and empowering other women, female leaders can help to create a more inclusive and equitable workforce.\n\n\n\r\nAt The Taplow Group help you source the best-fit for your organization's leadership through our CEO Recruiters.

Now employees are questioning what is important to them and how they want to spend their time, more than ever. Work-life balance is no longer about just clocking in and out, but rather finding a way to be fulfilled both at work and at home. Employees are now looking for ways to integrate their work and personal lives in a way that benefits both. What began as ‘The Great Resignation’ has transformed into ‘Quite Quitting’, a situation where employees do not necessarily quit their jobs but are no longer putting in more time, effort, or enthusiasm than absolutely necessary to keep their job going.\n\n\nIt is clearly evident that the workplace climate and culture are the root cause of this paradigm shift. To prevent this trend, organizations need to take intentional steps to meet the mental, physical, spiritual, and well-being needs of employees. It's time to focus on these critical points and steer organizational culture in that direction.\n\n\nRedefining organizational culture is essential to creating a healthy and productive workforce. Remember, it can only spring from a culture that supports one. If you want to fix the problems of well-being and wellness, you need to fix the problems of the organization's culture. This means valuing employees’ time and energy and creating a work environment that is supportive and satisfying. Employees who feel appreciated and valued are more likely to be productive and happy. Organizations must make work more human-centered to make their employees happy and productivity soar!\n\n\nThis article is an intellectual property of The Taplow Group.

However, one of the key factors to the success of hybrid teams is culture. For hybrid teams to be successful, the culture of the team must be aligned with the culture of the organization. If the cultures are not aligned, the team will not be as successful as it could be.\n\n\nAn organization's culture is the glue that holds it together. It's a culmination of the beliefs, values, and practices that people share. When embarking on a journey with distributed teams, it's important to be mindful of the culture and how it might be impacted.\n\n\nBy having a strong culture, you can ensure that everyone in the team is on the same page, knows what is expected of them, and feels like they are a part of something larger. This will help to keep the team cohesive and productive. A strong culture allows for the smooth communication and collaboration needed for these teams to be successful. On the other hand, a weak culture can lead to conflict and confusion.\n\n\nThe culture of an organization is not solely based on the location of its workforce, but on the strategies and practices that the organization implements to build its culture. If you want to keep your employees happy and productive, it's important to maintain the essence of the company culture in a hybrid setup. This will help to keep them attached to the organization's mission and make their jobs and roles more fulfilling.\n\n\nThis article is an intellectual property of The Taplow Group.

However, the events of the last couple of years have forced us to adapt to remote and hybrid working models. A Gartner report found that more than 70% of organizations have plans for permanent remote working models. As the new mode of work evolves, so does leadership in a virtual world. One might argue that leadership is leadership, regardless of in-person or over a virtual medium – but the virtual world has some nuances which are very different. As a senior leader or CXO, you must be aware of these and develop yourself to succeed with our \nCEO training program\n.\n \nCommunication is the key\n \nThe virtual world has opened a new medium of communication. As a leader, you need to know which one to choose for what kind of communication. Chats are effective for quick check-ins or informal connects while you can choose an email for formal and detailed communication – mostly the ‘official’ ones. Besides, ensure that you often have video calls to reduce the ‘zoom fatigue’ and bring in some ‘human’ element in the connections.\n \nBe clear and transparent\n \nThough you can connect with people located miles away, courtesy of virtual communication platforms, you cannot gauge the reactions as effectively as you could have done in a physical setting. There are multiple snags in communication in this remote model and as a leader you have to communicate in a clear, crisp, and transparent manner. Acknowledge the challenges faced by team members, communicate efforts taken by the organization to support employees, plan employee engagement programs, and communicate developments in a transparent manner.\n \nFoster relationship\n \nIt can be very challenging to develop bonds and relationships when you are not meeting in person. However, you can still foster and nurture relationships with your fellow leaders and team members. This is something that can set you apart from other leaders and make a difference. Listen to your employees – make them feel valued, be it about their personal lives or their career ambitions. You can always try to hop on a short video call with no agenda – just an informal catch-up.\n \nSupport your employees\n \nIf you are looking to develop yourself as a leader in the virtual world, then you have to be very supportive – even more than in the physical setting. It is hard for everyone to work from home and adapt to the new models. As a leader, you can look to support them with medical help, leaves, engagements to take care of mental health, etc. Try to conduct monthly town halls to bring in everyone and share accomplishments – not only professional but also personal.\n \nFinally, do not forget about yourself\n \nBefore you go out and do all the above, take care of your health and mental well-being. Keep yourself hydrated and surround yourself with positive vibes. Remember, even if you are at the helm, it is absolutely alright to seek help and assistance.\n \nBecoming a leader is challenging, become one in the virtual world is even more – you need not worry with you have the best CEO training program to hone your skills from the best \nCEO search services\n firm.\n \nAt The Taplow Group help you source the best-fit for your organization's leadership through our CEO search services.

First, start by setting your goals and planning your steps. Next, take action and stay focused on your goals. Finally, stay positive and don't give up when things get tough. However, one thing that's common amongst successful people is that they’ve all had mentors and sponsors throughout their career because when you need to make important decisions, it can be hard to get perspective without guidance.\n \nSo, what's the difference between mentorship and sponsorship?\n \nMentorship and sponsorship are often confused. A mentor is someone who can help guide you and offer advice about your career. On the other hand, a sponsor is someone in the workplace who will advocate for you, which is different from a mentor. One of your leaders will usually be the person this is who will help you further your career with promotion recommendations and opportunities.\n \nSponsors and mentors play different but important roles in your career. While sponsors are more likely to be in a position to help you advance in your career, mentors can provide guidance and support along the way. It’s important to have both in your professional network.\n \nMentorships and sponsorships are both powerful tools that can help create more diverse workplaces, foster belonging, and develop tomorrow’s leaders. By providing access to mentorships, employees can learn from those who have walked in their shoes and understand the challenges they face. Sponsorships can help employees feel seen and supported and provide access to opportunities. When both mentorship and sponsorship are available in organizations, everyone benefits.\nThis article is an intellectual property of The Taplow Group.

With a high-performing team, you can achieve wonders – increased profits, enhanced brand image, and a sustainable edge over the competition resulting in a successful organization.\n\n\nResearch on high-performing teams and their culture tells us that it is the degree of commitment and the sense of purpose that sets apart these teams from the rest.

That’s where our expertise in \nhuman capital services\n comes as a saving grace.\n\n\nWe understand that building and maintaining a high-performance team culture is part of \nhuman capital development\n within an organization. This involves building values like integrity, emotional intelligence, unbiased and effective feedback, analytical skills, trust and faith in one another, and staying committed to each member. Let us share some of the tips and tricks on building such a team culture within your organization.\n\n\nSet a clear vision for the team\n\n\nEven if you have the best talent, without a vision, or a purpose, they will inevitably fail. The first step is to clearly define a vision and then align individual and team roles according to the vision. This would give direction to the team and also motivate the group to work toward that common goal. At times, when things go south, this purpose will act as the motivation and keep your team on track.\n\n\nEstablish transparent communication\n\n\nWe have mentioned that one of the essential qualities of such a culture is trust and faith – and this can only step from an unambiguous and transparent communication medium. This communication channel should be bi-directional and open at all times. All members should be encouraged to share their opinions and feedback – promoting open discussions on where the team stands concerning the common goals and vision.\n\n\nSet up time and scope for feedback\n\n\nFeedback is the breakfast of champions. It does not come as a surprise that the best-performing teams share open to feedback about each other and the organization as a whole. What sets them apart is that this feedback is constructive – it is timely, specific, and actionable.\n\n\nInvest in human capital development\n\n\nInvest in training programs to empower your team members. These should not only consider the organization-wide goals, but also individual aspirations. If you give your team enough scope to explore their ambitions and career options, then it would motivate and encourage them to perform better at work.\n\n\nMeasure performance\n\n\nSetting up parameters and measuring success is a crucial element in this journey. Unless you benchmark yourself against set standards you would not know how much effort and resources to put in to stay ahead in the game.\n\n\nBuilding such a team won’t happen overnight. It requires dedication, commitment, and partnering with the right \nhuman resources consulting firm\n to make it happen. Contact us today to learn more about our services!

Are you planning a leadership succession? If yes, then you must be moving mountains! It is indeed a mammoth task to filter through potential candidates and then find the right selection for your top leadership. The cost of a wrong hire can be beyond imagination. Survey results show that more than 50% of the newly recruited top leaders struggle to make an impact or live up to their billing. Instead of wasting time and resources, you can simply partner with us - a leading \nexecutive search management consulting\n firm.\n\n\nWhat sets us apart from the rest is that we focus on hiring character, not skills! No Surprises? We will align you with a specialist, who is a seasoned executive search consultant operating in your industry. We believe that character and personality go way beyond skills in defining a successful leader.

We have access to top talent across multiple industries and would find the right fit for your position in the least amount of time.\n\n\nSave time and money\n\n\nIf you outsource hiring, it will definitely come with a cost, but lower than the cost of a bad hire.

A lot of times, organizations spend a fortune in the hiring process and then another for training purposes. We will ensure that you are connected with the most competent leader so that you not only save on the hiring process but also spend the minimum in grooming the person for the job.\n\n\nMaintain complete transparency\n\n\nOutsourcing does not mean you will lose control.

It would not be an exaggeration to say that it has never been easy to find good people. Most organizations have adopted an \"all in\" approach to respond to these challenges when it comes to methods used for their \nhuman capital search\n.\n\n\nSo, how do organizations emerge as winners in this ‘Race for Talent’? Here are 5 best practices.\n\n\nHave a robust sourcing strategy\n\n\nCreating a well-thought-out strategy is the key to achieving success with any tactical plan. By collaborating with their cross-functional counterparts in HR, the modern sourcing team can build an efficient sourcing framework. Short-term (less than 30 days) and long-term (greater than 30 days) needs should both be considered when creating a strategy. A good strategy for short term needs should include looking internally and externally. A good strategy for longer term needs should include a search of the bench for internal sources, reprioritization, or escalation of existing project assignments, and supplemented by a talent development program aligned with project needs.\n\n\nGet the right mix of employees and interims \n\n\nFinding the sweet spot for using interims for project needs can be tricky. The key is to analyze your organization's average peak demand for resources and adjust your targeted level of employees to meet your average peak demand. From there, you'll need to develop a strategy to address peak-load needs that exceed employee capacity. Luckily, this process is far from impossible and can be very economical!\n\n\nKeep a warm pool of talent ready at all times\n\n\nOn an average it takes 30-60 days to source talent , bring them on board and make them productive. \nThe warm pooling process is a continuous effort to identify talented individuals in select cities and geographies. By building a warm pool of potential employees, the sourcing team can reduce the time it takes to find a productive new employee. The more sophisticated sourcing teams are always looking for ways to improve on-boarding processes to drive time and cost out of the recruiting process.\n\n\nUse automation for some part of sourcing\n\n\nImagine a team member who always completes their work on time, never calls in sick, never asks for a raise or promotion, and rarely makes mistakes! Yes, we are talking about automation. In today's world, something that would take you minutes if not hours can be automated and done in seconds. So why spend your time doing something that can be done in a fraction of the time? Moreover, it also enhances the candidate experience. Don’t forget that the candidate experience is as important as the candidates themselves! \n\n\nNot just attract but also retain\n\n\nFor organizations that lead with talent attraction and retention of talent is a strategic priority. There are a number of things you can do to improve your chances of retaining your top talent. First, make sure your employees feel appreciated. Show them that you value their contributions by recognizing their hard work. Secondly, provide them with opportunities for growth and development. Help them reach their full potential by giving them the chance to learn new skills and grow their careers. Finally, create a positive work environment. Make sure your employees feel comfortable and happy at work. This will help them stay motivated and engaged.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group we have extensive experience in designing, delivering, and benchmarking Human capital projects in addition to \nhuman capital services\n, to ensure our clients fully realize their employees’ full potential.

However, many organizations struggle to get results from their problem-solving efforts. There are several key steps that can be taken to ensure that problem solving is effective in an organization.\n\n\nBusinesses need to identify and correct issues, to ensure that they remain productive and profitable. While there are many techniques that can be used for problem solving, all of them require a clear and systematic approach.\n\n\nThe first step in any problem-solving process is to identify the problem. This can be done in a number of ways, but the most important part is to make sure that the problem is actually identified and understood. This can be a difficult task, especially when the problem is something that has been going on for a long time. It can be hard to see the forest for the trees, so to speak. It is also common for people to try to ignore or downplay the problem.\n\n\nOnce the problem is identified, the next step is to come up with potential solutions. This can be done through brainstorming, or by looking at past solutions that have worked in similar situations.\n\n\nNow that you have a general idea of the problem you want to solve, it's time to start gathering data. Gather as much information as possible to help develop a well-informed solution.\n\n\nOnce potential solutions have been identified, it is important to evaluate them and choose the best one. This process often includes considering factors such as feasibility, cost, and benefits. Once a solution is chosen, it is important to implement it and track the results. If the solution does not work, it is important to go back to the drawing board and try again.\n\n\nThis article is an intellectual property of The Taplow Group.

They can commit to full-time work over a defined period, such as a chief marketing officer who comes on board for 18 months for the launch a new product. Or part-time or fractional executives might come on board over a longer term but working only a few hours or a few days a week to keep staffing costs low. This flexibility can be a boon to companies who are looking to quickly ramp up their staffing for a specific project or initiative.\n\n\nThe flexibility of working makes this model perfect for any industry and size company, from early-stage to multi-billion-dollar businesses. It's also an option for non-profit organizations and public service entities.\n\n\nHere's how organizations can benefit from Executive Interim Management Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuickly solve your leadership challenges\n- It takes time and money to hire a full-time executive with the right experience and interest in your company.

At a time when being resilient is no longer a good to have, but a must-have for businesses, it is imperative that you future-proof your leadership development strategy. Investing in your leadership strategy will encourage and empower your entire organization, starting from the CEO’s office to the last mile. However, do you know where to start? If the captain of your ship is future-ready, then the rest of the crew will fall in place. Let us discuss how our \nCEO training program\n will help you develop your leadership strategies.\n\n\nGroom leaders beforehand\n\n\nYou should not wait for employees to join the C-suite before starting their executive training. Good succession planning involves preparing leaders beforehand. You should train and groom, preparing leaders even before they take actual office. This will prepare them for the challenges and help them grab the opportunities at the earliest. Develop that appetite for leadership throughout your organization.\n\n\nBring leaders out of their corner office\n\n\nWe believe that a CEO must have complete knowledge of the processes going on within the organization and outside. A CEO must be both cognizant of a day in the life of his sales team as well as his ideal customer. Exposure to discipline all across the business landscape will help hone the right set of leadership skills for your CEO. When he knows the ground reality, he will prepare his ground tight for future challenges.\n\n\nMake your leaders self-aware\n\n\nTo encourage, engage, and empower employees, a CEO should have clarity about his emotional self & his strengths, weaknesses, leadership, and communication styles. Being self-aware means, you can control your responses to situations as well as understand how others might and have reacted to the same. Use feedback from peers and direct subordinates to capture a 360-degree view of the strengths and areas of improvement.\n\n\nLeverage the digital technology\n\n\nIf the question is digital management an imperative for an organization's leaders? Then the answer is yes, but sadly the majority of the organizations lack leaders who are mature enough or well-versed in digital technology. In this 21st century, if you are not leveraging technology then you would fall behind your competitors. Now understanding digital does not end with a clarity of the latest devices and technology around you. As a CEO, he must take it to the next level & contextualizing it to the need of your organization, employees, and customers.\n\n\nCustomize learning for leaders\n\n\nDo not get all C-suite folks in one room and have a one-week classroom session. Though it has its own merits, it does not hold good for CEO training programs. Every business is different, every industry is different and so is every \nCEO’s training program\n. We tailor-make it to best suit your business requirement, helping you future-proof your leadership development strategies with our CEO coaching as well.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group help you source the best-fit for your organization's leadership through our CEO search services. We are also one of the leading \nBoard Governance Services Firm\n.

A number of top executives say \"I hire the best people and get out of their way\" when asked about their leadership style. Of course, hiring the right people is the most important part of building a strong team, and delegating to give people more autonomy is a powerful motivator. However, managing a team is not simple. Leaders must take a more hands-on role to ensure the group functions well together and remains focused on the correct priorities.\n \nIt is important for a leader to establish values and goals in order to measure team performance. Without these, it would be difficult to improve as a team. Furthermore, if a team does not have values or goals, they are more likely to become stagnant and lose motivation. Strong leaders are not afraid to make difficult decisions, course correct when needed, and set high standards of performance that are constantly being met and improved.\n \nSome of the questions that need to be answered are:\n \n \n \nWhat do we really care about in performing our job?\n \n \n \nWhat does success mean to this team?\n \n \n \nWhat actions can we take to reach our goals?\n \n \n \nTeams need strong leadership to ensure that they will reach their goals, work together effectively, and perform at their best. If you want to be an effective leader, you need to be committed to your work and be accountable and responsible for your actions. As a strong leader, try to cultivate adaptability, welcome feedback, and motivate team members to do their best work.\n \nThis article is an intellectual property of The Taplow Group.

How can we implement this in practice? Time is of the essence! You and your organization are also facing these questions as your company makes a strategic shift?\n \nNew ways of working, an ever-changing VUCA environment, a strategic transformation, a new leader, a company takeover, a digital transformation... Each company has its own challenges to overcome. If its culture does not follow the curve of these new shifts, the mission, the objective, will not be achieved to the extent of the ambitions initially set. This growing awareness is forcing many large companies to invest in their raison d'être and their cultural fundamentals. It is becoming essential for them to really focus on this: What to change? And how to go about it?\n \nWhat is a Corporate Culture?\n \nIt's not just about offering modern offices worthy of the largest high-tech organizations. The culture of an organization is much more subtle than that, based on a number of intangible factors that increase a sense of belonging, security and trust. Examples?\n \n- Rather than setting up an unlimited number of vacations, how about setting complete disconnection when employees leave the workplace as the norm?\n \n- How about privileging the result of a job well done rather than the number of hours or days spent in the office to accomplish it?\n \nIn other words, psychological trust and security cannot be bought or manufactured. They cannot be solved by providing sports facilities or free snacks alone.\n \nHow can we concretely bring it to life?\n \nA cultural transformation requires time, patience, and resilience. It does not only belong to Human Resources but also to team leaders, to the executive committee... who must treat it as a priority and allocate the necessary resources. It is essential to be aware of the impossibility of leading a cultural transformation with an already overloaded or exhausted workforce. Last but not least, motivational levers are still needed to encourage operations to change and collaborate.\n \nThree fundamental pillars can be identified for successful cultural transformation management:\n \nTake the pulse of the organization: Understand what needs to change, what needs to continue, what needs to be stopped. Have a continuous improvement approach as we would do in production.\n \nBe aware of the organization's social mapping: Who are the real influencers within the company? Who will be the major players in this cultural transformation at all levels?\n \nHave a Top-Down and Bottom-Up transformation dynamic: Put in place the necessary initiatives so that the engine is not only at the head of the train but also comes from the operations.\n  \n \nAdapt or leave\n \nIt is important to remember that we are each responsible for our own actions on a daily basis. It only takes one bad element to harm the harmony of an organization, the customer relationship... It is essential to realize the impact we can have, personally, on the trust, security or performance of our circle of influence. As difficult as it may be, it may be essential to let go of those elements whose actions and behaviors would be harmful to the cultural health of the organization.\n \nIn conclusion, Corporate Culture is neither a philosophical nor a utopian subject! It is a real human subject. It's high time to deal with it properly! Do you also have new challenges that require a cultural transformation of your organization? We can help You!

Every organization wants to be high on the DEI index but implementing practices that ensure diversity and inclusivity is a completely different ball game. It is easier said than done. This is where our \nhuman capital search services\n \ncome into the picture. We help you build the right strategies, head hunt in the right avenues, and ensure that you improve your hiring diversity.\n\n\nIncreasing diversity or the DEI index for your organization does not simply mean that you start hiring from different backgrounds. It is a principle, a practice that should be deeply rooted in all strategies of the organization right from hiring, to onboarding, to succession planning, and employee engagement. So, how do you increase diversity through your hiring practices .\n\n\nUnderstand the AS-IS state\n\n\nYou should start by understanding the present state of your diversity initiatives. Talk to your present employees, gather feedback from the newly recruited ones, and understand where you stand. This will help you in identifying your gaps and at the same time ensure that the top management also realizes them as a shortcoming or avenues where there is the scope for improvement.\n\n\nSpeak the diverse language\n\n\nAcross all channels of your communication – social media pages, websites, corporate posters, or emailers – you should speak the same consistent language. This would create the impression that diversity as a practice is deeply embedded within your organization’s culture. You would be surprised to know that many potential candidates check diversity and inclusivity practices before choosing a firm. Hence consistent communication would enhance your brand image and help you attract top talents.\n\n\nRemove biases during hiring\n\n\nThe approach should be to be consciously un-bias rather than unconsciously biased. This means that you should take every single effort to remove bias from your recruitment process. This even includes terms in the job description that might be aligned toward a particular gender. During the interview process, ensure that you talk about your DEI practices and also take feedback from the participant as to how you can improve diversity in your hiring process.\n\n\nHave an inclusive onboarding\n\n\nEnsure that employees across the firm are onboarded in a similar manner. During onboarding, you make them aware of your DEI policies and help each employee realize the importance of such policies at an individual and organizational level. Moreso, you should encourage them to suggest ways to enhance these policies and speak up when they feel such policies are being violated.\n\n\nClose the loop and measure success\n\n\nYou started with identifying your gaps, and now it is time to measure success. Check how much progress you have made by interviewing your employees once again. At the same time, take feedback on the performance of your new hires, giving insight into the quality of the hire. It is crucial that you look back and refine areas that are still lagging. Our\n \nhuman capital services\n \nare designed to help you enhance your hiring diversity. We know where to begin.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, a leading \nHuman Capital Consultancy Services\n Firm\n we believe that the key to a successful organization lies in its people, and our team of experienced consultants is dedicated to helping you find and develop the best talent.

Great preparations show that you are serious about the meeting, your objectives are clear, and you are going to add value for your client.\n \nHave an agenda\n \nNo one should enter the meeting without knowing why this session has been set up or who would lead it or what items would be discussed.

Is managing employees remotely very different from managing employees in the office? The answer is NO! With small steps and little effort, you can become the best remote manager.\n\n\nConnect for building connections, not work \n– Spend time on 1:1 calls, but not take just only take work-related updates. It should be more to build a connection with your fellow associates. Use these opportunities to understand what your fellow team members need. Are they feeling supported, or they are feeling stuck? What do they think about improving efficiency at work? Are they happy with their work? Spend time as a coach, a friend, and a benefactor to become an ideal manager at work.\n\n\nKeep communications public\n – Everything except private matters should be discussed as a team. This allows room for transparency, and everyone knows what is going on within the team. If you practice direct messaging, your employees will follow the same and it would evidently lead to miscommunication and unnecessary troubles. Follow the simple rule, praise in public and criticize in private.\n\n\nMake sure that teams take a break\n – There is nothing worse than leading a fatigued and burnt-out team. Give your team members enough scope to take leaves and breaks from work. Certain organizations follow a system of mandatory holidays as well. Also, ensure that you monitor the workload diligently and ensure that it is well-balanced among all team members.\n\n\nFollow these simple tips and you will become the manager that everyone would aspire to become and love to work for!\n\n\nThis article is an intellectual property of The Taplow Group.

    "content": "Bringing Learning To The C Suite With Our CEO Training Program\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nWednesday, August 10, 2022\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo survive and thrive in this dynamic business world, organizations need to continuously unlearn and learn. However, it is not enough that every organization has a learning and development department to handle this. Leaders must rethink the WHYs of learning followed by the HOWs of the learning.\n \nBefore we look into the ways of enhancing corporate learning and how a \nCEO training program\n is relevant today, more than in the past, let us understand the forces that are changing the learning ecosystem. The basis of competition is changing – it is no longer about products and services, but also about agility, resilience, and the learning advantage – the way organizations are reimaging learning and development. The second force is the way work models are evolving – upskilling and reskilling will become regular activities as we move into new ways of delivering work. Finally, the HOW of learning is changing – it is no longer limited to classroom hours and instructor-led training. The training models should upgrade themselves to meaningful models where employees retain and use the training imparted to them.\n \nLooking for a starting point? Here we go \n \n#1 Learning should begin from the top\n \nLearning should start from the top. It should not be limited to improving the skills and competencies but expanded to improve the overall mode of business conduct within the organization. This is where our CEO training program comes into the picture. This should involve shifting learning from just an HR function to creating a new vertical under a Chief Learning Officer.\n \n#2 Build the new vertical\n \nOnce the new learning vertical has been set, you can look to groom architects and create content to engage your employees. This means that tech folks, designers, and content curators need to work in tandem with each other and create a strong function to promote learning and development within the organization.\n \n#3 Make learning a continuous journey\n \nLearning should not be about forgetting. You must be surprised, but the reality is that most employees forget what they are taught in training sessions. Learning should be embedded in the everyday work activities so that employees not only learn but also remember since they would be applying their learnings at work.\n \n#4 Harness the power of the tech\n \nLeverage the new learning platforms that operate on the next-gen technology stack. These platforms provide intuitive and interactive content and make learning a fun-filled and engaging activity. At the same time, it would help you keep track of the entire process, progress updates for individuals, and share content at ease.\n \n#5 Create an ecosystem of learning\n \nLearning should be there right from the last mile employee to the entire community at large. Think about individual learning, team learning, CEO Training Program, organizational learning, and the community at large. It would create an ecosystem involving all stakeholders – customers, suppliers, academicians, and board members.\n \nIf you are looking to revamp the learning ecosystem and stay ahead of the competition, you must partner with one of the best \nleadership development management services firm\n and leverage an enterprise-grade CEO training program.\n \nAt The Taplow Group help you source the best-fit for your organization’s leadership through our \nCEO search services\n.\n \nTo know more about our services like leadership coaching, professional hiring, management consulting, reach out to us at www.taplowgroup.com\nThis article is an intellectual property of The Taplow Group.

However, this is not something new and can be dated way back to the early 1900s when organizations did promote this concept of a temporary workforce.\n\n\nThe gig economy allows employees to work as freelancers, choose their projects, and float from one to another in a digital marketplace. Over the last couple of years, more and more people are joining the gig workforce, where they prefer to work on their terms. A report suggests that by 2027, more than half of the US workforce will work as freelancers. Technology and digital advancements have made it even easier for employees to work as freelancers. Geographical distance is no longer a barrier and organizations get such a diverse workforce with them.\n\n\nThe main drivers behind this growth are the flexibility offered by this model and the cost savings that it brings to the enterprises. It creates a unique coherence between the demand and supply sides. Employees are getting the flexibility to choose their projects, work hours, and work locations, and at the same time enjoy their lives according to their own terms. On the other hand, this work model results in cost savings for organizations as they need not hire full-time employees. It goes without saying that 2022 and beyond will see more and more people joining this trend.\n\n\nIt would be interesting to see how organizations come up with policies to welcome and retain more of this gig economy workforce and in turn increase their bottom line as well.\n\n\n \n\n\nThis article is an intellectual property of The Taplow Group.

Whether it's due to a sudden departure, a natural transition, or a major shift in the market, interim management can provide the stability and leadership needed to keep the business moving forward.\n\n\nYou must have heard of special task forces in the context of armed forces or law enforcement agencies. However, a lot of enterprises are now deploying this special task force in the form of interim managers as an alternative to a full-time C-suite employee. These executives start on full throttle within a few days, deliver the results, and move out. Turning around from a revenue decline, launching a new product, managing a merger, or getting a new practice in place are some of the reasons why businesses are looking for interim managers.\n\n\nWhy should you engage in executive interim management? What benefits can you expect out of interim managers?\n\n\nIndustry experience\n\n\nThere is no dearth of experience when it comes to our executive interim management services. Our executives have decades of experience in building firms, turning things around, or launching new products. These executives love to stay on the edge and deliver results on the go. They move from one company to another and share their experience, helping others succeed as well. They have a lot of experience in their bag, and they are ready for any challenge that you might throw at them.\n\n\nResults are all that matters\n\n\nThese interim executives are laser-focused on their goals. They do not have a lot of time, and hence they always cut the background noise and focus on delivering results within the period allocated to them. Interim managers will not talk about theories and ideas, they will talk about execution and results. Their performance is measured by the deliverables they bring to the table. It is no less than a mission and they will do any extra mile to achieve the desired targets.\n\n\nCross-industry expertise\n\n\nThese executives are like the rolling stone – they will never gather any moss. Since they move from one company to another, one industry to another, they do not develop any blind spots and it enables them to think with greater clarity and rationale. These executives will bring the best practices from different industries to your business. Talk about the latest tech stack, skills, capabilities, and domain knowledge, and you have them all with your interim executive.\n\n\nEmpower and build\n\n\nThese leaders are on a mission, and they need resources to help them, meaning, they need a team that is focused and can work together toward a common goal. These managers empower fellow associates and serve as a mentor that can put together a team that can work toward a common goal. Team building, mentorship, and empowering fellow employees are some of the tenets on which these managers build their strategies.\n\n\nSustainability\n\n\nOur interim executive management can provide a wide range of solutions, from short-term to long-term, to help your company succeed. You might think that if these managers barely stay over a year, then how come they have a lasting impact? That’s the beauty of their work. They create a sustainable impact on the company and its operations – an impact that will last even when these managers take the exit. To quote an interim manager, they strive to ‘leave the organization in a better position’.\n\n\nIf you are looking for the next set of leaders to drive change and stay resilient, then you should consider interim managers and engage with our executive interim management.\n\n\nTo know more about our \nExecutive Interim Management Services \n, visit www.taplowgroup.com\n\n\nThis article is an intellectual property of The Taplow Group.

So why do candidates ghost recruiters?\n\n\nAnother job offer\n\n\nMajority of the candidates ghost in case they have received another job offer, an offer with better compensation and perks. The ball is in the court of the candidates in an employee-driven job market.\n\n\nPoor communication\n\n\nHave you made your candidates wait for long to get replies from you? It might have been that you were waiting for interview feedback or simply got things delayed – whatever the case if you fail to communicate on time, you cannot expect them to wait for you forever.\n\n\nLong hiring process\n\n\nA lot of organizations have lengthy hiring processes, and candidates lose interest and end up ghosting the process. If you do not respect your candidates’ time, then they would not bother to stick with you.\n\n\nNot the right job\n\n\nA lot of times candidates realize that they are not interviewing for the right job. They find ghosting easier than communicating the actual reason.\n\n\nPrevious experience\n\n\nWhat goes around comes around – almost 80% of candidates have been ghosted by some recruiter or other during their professional life. They just feel it is right to give it back.\n\n\nFocus on the candidate experience, be open and prompt with your communication, and speed up the process so that you do not lose any more candidates.\n\n\n© This article is an intellectual property of The Taplow Group.

Thanks to recent technological developments and artificial intelligence, employees can accomplish the same amount of work in less time while still providing end-to-end services to clients.\n\n\nHere are the Benefits of a 4 Day Work Week:\n\n\nIncreased Productivity\n\n\nStanford University did an in-depth investigation into the relationship and productivity and discovered a clear link between the two factors. Employees that are overworked are less productive than those who work a normal or average week.\n\n\nAn Equal Workplace\n\n\nAccording to the Government Equalities Office's research on the Gender Pay Gap, around two million Britons are currently unemployed due to childcare responsibilities, with women accounting for 89% of those affected. Employees would be able to spend more time with their families and maintain a better balance between care and job commitments with a four-day work week, resulting in a more equal workplace.\n\n\nBetter Employee Engagement\n\n\nEmployees who work a four-day week are more likely to be happier and more committed. Because they have plenty of time to rest and recover, employees are less likely to be stressed or take sick leaves. As a result, they return to work energised and ready to face new challenges.\n\n\nA Smaller Carbon Footprint\n\n\nShorter working hours are associated with a lower carbon footprint, thus cutting the work week from five to four days could also be beneficial to the environment. Shortening the work week will lead to fewer commutes as major office buildings are only in use four days a week, which directly leads to fewer carbon emissions.\n\n\nThis article is an intellectual property of The Taplow Group.

Over the past two years, businesses have faced multiple challenges with their \nglobal executive search\n. Be it with the restrictions, hybrid mode of work, or closed borders, the list can go on. With this context set, it would be crucial to understand the top trends that would govern the market in the coming future. It would not only help you attract the best talent but also make you more resilient to the uncertainties to come.\n \n#1 Employers are no longer in the driving seat for global executive search\n \nYes, you have read it right. It has become a candidate-driven market and there are more jobs than eligible and competent candidates for the same. Hence, organizations need to come up with innovative strategies to reach out to candidates and attract them for the best roles. This would require some creative hiring strategies, data-driven decision-making, and effective brand communication.\n \n#2 Remote recruitment will continue\n \nEven though we are slowly coming out of the pandemic, things will not go back to the normal that existed before the pandemic. We will have to embrace the new normal and so would \nglobal executive search services\n. Remote recruitments will continue, and organizations need to become more tech-savvy and use tech innovations and devices to accelerate the process as well as provide the best experience to each candidate.\n \n#3 Passive hiring will increase\n \nOrganizations will have to reach the candidates and not the other way round. You have to attract talent with your brand name, challenging job role, attractive work culture, and employee-friendly policies and work environment. The opportunity to learn more, work in a better environment, or take up new challenges will bring candidates toward your organization. This trend will continue since the market is candidate driven, hence passive hiring will play a pivotal role.\n \n#4 Longer notice periods\n \nIn an attempt to hold on to and retain employees, organizations can think about longer notice periods – 90 days on an average from 30 to 60-day period. This would give them enough time to understand the reasons and maybe come up with policies and compensation to retain the employee. In this market, this trend will come up, and though it may not be working for the candidates will be something that would work for the organizations, as employers.\n \n#5 Borders are no longer a barrier\n \nSomeone sitting in China can run business in the US, while someone from India can operate organizations in Europe. Truly, the world is now a global village and people from across the world are being hired without any consideration of the geographic barriers. With remote work models and digital tools, this will make things easy and help organizations recruit a diverse workforce.\n \nThese are the top trends that would drive \nglobal executive search\n. Our consultants are well versed with the market and its trends and will help you achieve results above and beyond your expectations.\n \nWe will help you source the best-fit for your organization’s leadership through our \nglobal executive search consultants\n.

However, let us park our thoughts, and before we deep dive into how AI can help in human capital services let us understand what is meant by AI. In simple words, it is a software/program/algorithm that can mimic human cognitive intelligence. AI encompasses multiple technological innovations like machine learning (ML), computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and likewise. There is no doubt that artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way we live and work. From self-driving cars to predictive analytics, AI is providing us with new ways to make our lives easier, safer and more efficient.\n\n\nNow, AI is also starting to transform the way we search for and select talent. Just as AI is being used to match job seekers with open positions, it is also being used to identify the most qualified candidates for specific roles.\n\n\nHere's how AI is helping in the human capital search process –\n\n\nPrepare the hiring funnel with a steady candidate pool\n\n\nAI can start even before you reach out to prospective candidates. With the help of algorithms, you can eliminate biases, unnecessary jargon, and sensitive terms from your job posting, making them more suitable for a wide pool of candidates. At the same time, think about those who may not be seeking jobs actively, yet have tremendous talent that can benefit you. AI is your answer to reach out to this passive pool of candidates and widen your hiring funnel.\n\n\nScreen resume in a short span of time\n\n\nResume screening can be a taxing and time-consuming process when done manually. However, when done via AI it can not only complete it in a shorter period of time but also eliminate any kind of errors that might have been present due to the human aspect. AI can screen resumes based on word search, skill match, and even match them with the present set of employees to make the profiles more closely aligned with the work and culture of your organization.\n\n\nConduct interviews\n\n\nThe next step in the \nhuman capital search services\n where AI adds value is in conducting interviews. AI can conduct online interviews and evaluate a candidate based on their responses and facial expressions. You can leverage AI for initial rounds of interviews. It would save time and effort and give every candidate a consistent experience irrespective of their sex, religion, region, background, or ethnicity.\n\n\nHelp onboard new joiners\n\n\nNothing better than your friend AI helping your new hires during their initial days. It can start from what documents to carry, and what trainings to be completed to regular processes, like how to fill the timesheet or how to claim for reimbursements. It would not only make life easy for new hires but also reduce a lot of administrative burdens from the HR team.\n\n\nEfficient workforce management\n\n\nFinally, AI can also help you allocate your resources in the best possible manner. Based on historical records, skill sets of employees, and an estimate of the future demands, AI will devise the best possible staffing or resource allocation. This will help you enhance employee productivity thus achieving better results with workforce management.\n\n\nAI is that friend who is a jack of all trades, a master of all. Like human capital search, it is transforming other areas in the world of business. Embrace this new buddy and allow it to make lives easier for you!\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group we not only help you source the best-fit for your organization’s leadership through our executive search consultants but also train and develop them to hone their skills.

They can also help to resolve conflicts, improve communication, and develop a culture of accountability.\n\n\nWhat To Look For in Executive Interim Management \n\n\nIf you're looking for interim management services, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, be sure to choose a firm that has a lot of experience in the field. Second, make sure the firm has a good reputation and is known for providing quality services.\n\n\nInterim Executive Management\n can be used to address a variety of issues, including:\n\n\n\n\nStrategic planning\n\n\nRestructuring\n\n\nTurnaround\n\n\nPerformance improvement\n\n\nChange management\n\n\n\n\nFinding the ideal executive interim manager is just the beginning of the process.

Using tech to find new talent will help you streamline and accelerate your process. When you streamline activities, you can save on time and resources, ultimately reducing the overall costs of sourcing and hiring.\nNext comes simple automation. The emails that follow standard templates can be easily automated. Similarly, many other manual efforts can be ramped up using automation. You can even go for an applicant tracking system (ATS) for organizing the resumes, scanning through them, and keeping you updated about the progress in the system.\nWhen you adopt tech in the hiring process, you will increase productivity, reduce chances of a bad match, save time and money, and eventually hire the most resourceful candidate out there!\nThis article is an intellectual property of The Taplow Group.

The importance of these programs can be seen in the process of \n CEO search servicesM\n as well. \nCEO recruiters\n are seeking for those candidates who have undergone professional \nCEO certifications\n – those who are future-ready?\n\n\n\r\nWhat benefits are you going to achieve through Our CEO Training Program?\n\n\n\r\n1. \nReskilling and upskilling \n– Do you know enough? The answer will always be a resounding ‘NO’ in the modern ever-evolving business world, powered by technology. To stay relevant CEOs, need to fill the skill gaps. This does not mean that a CEO needs to know everything from Tally to Tableau, from ERP to CRM to HCM. However, he/she should be at par with the latest trends in technology, understand their business implications, and how these modern developments can add business value and generate profits for the organization\n\n\n\r\n2. \nWiden perspectives\n – A CEO is like the captain of the ship. A narrow mindset would result in a massive crash. A \nCEO training program\n would infuse the idea of diversity, equality, and inclusion into the leaders of tomorrow. Leaders must be open to new ideas. Opportunities are there around the corner for those who are seeking them and then can strategize to maximize them\n\n\n\r\n3. \nEstablish a strong network\n – Your net worth is your network – a very popular and relevant phrase in the industry. The world is evolving at such a rapid pace that it is very difficult for one person to be on top of everything. This is where your network of friends, professionals, and like-minded individuals help. Discuss new trends, find out more, discover how the world of business is navigating through these, and gather novel ideas or at least lay the groundwork for your future strategies\n\n\n\r\n4. \nEnhance organizational performance\n – Your organization is not driven by one person, but by all the employees and stakeholders. As a CEO it is very important to understand the organization’s culture, vision, and dynamics of work. Without this, one cannot align his/her vision with that of the organization. The second aspect here is communication. A CEO should speak to all – all employees should be able to resonate with the same vision and culture. Putting these together the result is improved performance, and no doubt improved the bottom line as well.\n\n\n\r\nModern-day \n CEO recruiters\n are putting a lot of stress on professional \nCEO certification\n and training programs. These make you future-ready and in turn helps organizations to thrive and stay resilient.\n\n\n\r\nOur \nCEO Training program\n is designed to provide the skills and knowledge required to be a successful CEO. In addition to this we also offer leadership coaching, professional hiring, and management consulting services.

In a study conducted by Tracking Happiness, around 12,455 workers across the globe show that remote work increases happiness by 20%.\n\n\n\n\nExpected or surprised?\n\r\nThe study also goes on to report that millennials are most excited about remote models giving them more time with themselves and family and flexibility to choose their work locations and arrangements. We also see a deep connection between work happiness and overall life happiness, where about 27% of a person’s happiness can be attributed to work-related happiness. These findings clearly show that employers should encourage more remote work as remote work equals happy employees equals productive employees.\n\n\n\r\nThough a lot of employees might argue on this and quote work from the office to be productive; be it on personal grounds or the nature of work, we believe that the final say should be given to the employees – work from the home, office, or hybrid. Maybe in-person check-ins can be done for evaluations or team-building activities, while the majority of the work is done remotely.\n\n\n\r\nIt has been observed that as commute time increased, employee happiness decreased. Of course! You don’t want to spend precious moments in the hustle-bustle of the traffic. To conclude, we can say that an empty office is always better than unhappy employees. Thus, promote flexibility and let your employees choose their work models and arrangements in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3209)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

In such a dynamic world, every leader, and every CEO needs to have a futuristic vision for himself, for the organization, for clients, and for the employees to keep the organization ahead of the competition. How to make sure that you are ready to lead the organization of the future?\n\n\n\r\nWhile searching and recruiting future CEOs, \n CEO recruiters\n not only look at hard skills and competencies but also soft skills like communication, people skills, and cultural alignment. If you have a \n CEO certification\n from a recognized institution, it'll go a long way in keeping you ahead in the selection process.\n\n\n\r\nOur \n certified CEO training program\n will help you realize your potential, unearth hidden talents, help you stay relevant with the latest skills, and prepare you to lead an organization in the best possible way. If you ask, what are the top attributes that a CEO should have – then every John can list down things like innovation, creativity, agility, collaboration, team-player, and the list can go on. But the real question is how to be innovative, be creative in decision making?\n\n\n\n\nWhy a CEO certification program?\n\r\nIf you want the answers, then look at our CEO certification program today! We believe that a combination of your experience, coupled with coaching and networking will help you uniquely develop skills and make you future-ready!\n\n\n\r\nThink about this! How will you bring in a change or evoke innovative thinking within an organization? One immediate response would be to throw in some emergencies and make people think on their feet. We believe that it would surely evoke a lot of thinking and a burst of energy, but it would not be long-lasting. Our experts believe that evoking a change by highlighting a crisis or instilling fear can give you results, but they are not sustainable. In this dynamic world of business, there is no point in momentary gains. As a leader, you have to build sustainable strategies, and long-term plans that will not only help the organization thrive today but also make it resilient for the future.\n\n\n\r\nThus, think big, think beyond fear or crisis and think about opportunities – situations or chances that are exciting will generate profit and goodwill, and also make employees productive. Combine this with the vision you have for the organization and clearly articulate the same throughout so that every individual knows the role he/she is playing in the game.\n\n\n\r\nThis was just an example of how a textbook leader plays differently than a certified and well-trained leader. Our\n\n\nCEO certification program\n is not just a mere list of topics delivered in one directional manner. The experts here have observed leaders and CEOs from different industries across the world. Then they have extracted behavioral patterns, skills, and success factors, and combined everything into the present pedagogy that you see.\n\n\n\r\nIf you want to lead organizations and if you want to be the first choice of \n CEO recruiters\n, then connect with us today – your best ally that will help you evolve into an incredible leader!

However, it has an ever-changing definition overtime. Regular and repeated patterns have been replaced by meaningful and constructive tasks.\n\n\n\n\nHere are some challenges that we have observed regarding workplace efficacy\n\n\n\n\nTime allocation: Urgent vs. Important\n\r\nIn a professional environment, we have learned to classify jobs into urgent and significant categories. What is urgent is due first, and what is important is the top priority. The golden rule is to prioritize the urgent at the earliest and plan ahead for the important.\n\r\nIf necessary, over-communicate with the team to ensure that everyone is on the same page regarding the various deadlines of different projects.\n\n\n\n\nManaging Teams: Smart, Effective Collaboration\n\r\nTeamwork is an entirely different ballgame in the corporate world. Collaboration has always been difficult, and the introduction of remote working has made it even more complex. That is why smart and efficient collaboration is required for successful projects.\n\n\n\n\nManaging procedures: Get Rid of The Herd Mentality\n\r\nHerd mentality or going with the flow attitude restricts the provision of innovations which also limits creativity and damages the overall productivity of the organization in long run. However, in certain cases where processes aren't set or non-existent, they should be leveraged and re-evaluated on a regular basis.\n\n\n\n\nCulture Management: Learning and Compassion\n\r\nWhile there is a lot of emphasis on doing better for productivity, the importance of being better is often overlooked. Not only the Learning and Development function but also the overall environment is required to motivate employees to grow and contribute better to an organization.\n\r\nIn the end, it's not only clocking the hours but also adding values to those hours that matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2235)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

The new ways of work brought with them new expectations and scope for development. New tools and training models were formulated to cater to \n human capital development\n as we entered this uncharted territory of working amidst a global crisis. This global crisis impacted several economies worldwide and led to major changes which would continue to shape the way we work for times to come.\n\n\n\r\nTechnology became our main source of survival through the crisis, as it played a key role in keeping us well connected during times when we were all scooped in our homes. Technology also ensured WFH culture is incorporated smoothly. \n Human capital development\n also benefited significantly from this transition as employees could access training programs at their own convenience. All this time spent isolating also opened a new window of self-development and improving one’s skillset. People acquired new skills sitting in the comfort of their homes.\n\n\n\r\nBut there are two sides to every coin, social isolation greatly impacted the education and training market. People developed career-related anxiety and their mental health crumbled under the pressure of having a poor work-life balance. The lines got blurry quickly when it came to balancing one’s professional and personal lives as there were literally no walls between our offices and our living rooms.\n\n\n\n\nShifting Organizational Priorities on Human Capital Development\n\r\nAccording to the LinkedIn Learning report (2020), this crisis was a key contributor to change and has accelerated learning. Priorities of organizations have shifted and the focus on \nhuman capital development\n was increased as they require employees that are far more competent. This led to increased investment in \n human capital consultancy services\n. Employees at every level are feeling the constant pressure to better themselves and constantly outperform.\n\n\n\n\nIncreased Need for Human Capital Consultancy Services\n\r\nA lot of senior management couldn’t handle the pressure and decided to opt for early retirement amidst the crisis, which posed the challenge of replacing them quickly and finding talent that could lead everyone in the right direction. This increased the need for \nhuman capital consultancy services. \n\n\n\n\nChanging Learning Environment to Support Human Capital Development\n\r\nClassroom training and learning programs were shifted online. No one was prepared for this, and several changes had to be made to the existing learning strategies, including the drastic shift towards digital learning. Zoom calls are our new normal and virtual training seems to be here to stay. Even though technology has been our savior through this, it doesn’t come cheap and such quick \nhuman capital development\n came at a high price. Those who were technologically challenged no longer had a way to get away with it and had to improve their skills quickly to keep their jobs.\n\n\n\r\nThere was also a major drop in employee engagement and WFH culture somehow led to higher levels of fatigue. Employees burned out quickly and \nhuman capital development\n efforts had to be refocused on combating these new challenges. People feeling isolated while being in isolation was a given and it was difficult to create the same lively and exciting work environment via screens.\n\n\n\r\nAs we navigate through this crisis and its’ never-ending new variants, each organization is struggling to find its’ new normal. Some are trying the hybrid route; some have become far too comfortable with WFH to switch back. Achieving organizational goals in such difficult times requires agility.

Stress can be properly managed in a variety of ways, and you need to implement techniques that work best for you. Some tips for stress management are:\n\n\n \n\n\nIndulge in your hobbies\n\n\nWork-life balance is extremely significant\n, and one needs to prioritize their hobbies from time to time. This gives you time to disconnect and reboot. Invest your time in recreational activities as this lets your brain destress. Actively use the energy from stress to destress.\n\n\n \n\n\nTake a breather\n\n\nMeditation\n \ntakes you a long way when it comes to de-stressing and truly calms you down.\n Deep breathing frees up space in your brain and increases productivity massively.\n\n\n \n\n\nSpend quality time with your loved ones\n\n\nPositive social experiences\n and healthy conversations are key to stress management. Alienating yourself from human contact not only increases your stress levels but also contributes towards a burnout. Vent out to your friends in order to feel lighter and rejuvenated.\n\n\n \n\n\nLaugh away your troubles\n\n\nLaughter is stress’s biggest enemy\n. Watch standup comedy videos, scroll through reels or binge your favorite sit com at the end of the day to melt your worries and trick your brain into believing that everything is alright.\n\n\n \n\n\nAcknowledge your issues\n\n\nThe first step towards healing is acknowledgment of your problems\n. Embrace the situation, take a deep breath, walk around your desk, disconnect, and reboot. Find some way or the other to rightly express whatever it is that you’re experiencing, be it art or writing. Know that you’re letting go of the negative energy by expressing yourself.\n\n\n      \nTo actively practice stress management in your daily life, be compassionate, kind and caring towards yourself.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (4553)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "Source Talent in Competitive Markets With Our Executive Search Services\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nWednesday, May 4, 2022\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganizations often struggle with finding the right leadership talent as this market is extremely competitive. Choosing the right person for a leadership role is a very important decision and cannot be made on a whim or instinct. Your leadership essentially defines your organization and plays a key role in driving growth and success. Often, the right role is filled by using the right \n executive search services\n which maximizes the potential of finding the right match. At The Taplow Group our \n executive recruitment consultants\n deeply analyze the roles and find the most suitable candidates to fill the position. \nUnlike earlier, the job market is no longer solely focused on the employer. It’s a lot more candidate friendly, which makes it difficult to find top notch talent. Top candidates know what they bring to the table and expect compensation packages that justify their skillse And generous compensation package is not all it takes; candidates want to feel valued and needed. Tables have turned with organizations chasing employees and not the other way around and \n executive recruitment consultants \n understand this thoroughly. Organizations also need to shift focus on themselves and make themselves look more attractive and wholesome to work in. They need to highlight what differentiates them from their competitors. \n Executive search management consulting\n helps you get through this rigorous process and guarantees amazing results.\nThe trickiest part about attracting the right talent is that it’s not money. Contrary to what most organizations believe, it never was enough to have a lucrative compensation. The best candidates care more about the values and ethics of the organization and what it’s capable of achieving. The best talent always focuses on the bigger picture and how to get there. Best form of talent already has stable jobs with a fat paycheck and ample of growth opportunities. For them to shift, you need to offer them more, challenge their minds, entice them with other factors that differentiate you from their current employer. The competition for leadership talent is fierce. In order to successfully attract talent that could take your organization places, we follow a rigorous process at The Taplow Group that entails steps like:\nAnalyzing the need\nAn \n executive search consultant\n needs to be aware of what the role needs to accomplish, have a thorough understanding of the job description. Apart from understanding the present need, one also needs to understand the organization, be aware of its strengths and weaknesses, know the short-term goals as well as long term growth strategies. All this information is used by \n executive search consultants\n to attract the candidate to the job.\nPreparation for the search\nThe right candidate for the role is probably already well paid. A well-prepared plan helps increase interest and attract potential candidates to the opportunity. A good plan not only skillfully packages the organization and the role, but also finds a way to connect with candidates on a logical and emotional level.\nAttracting the right talent\nOn most occasions, the right talent is already well settled in another firm. Talent search is extremely gruesome and \n executive search\n services make the process smoother by shortlisting best of the best.\nAssessing the talent\nAfter initial contact and follow ups, if the candidate is as excited by the prospect as you are,talent assessment is conducted which could be the most difficult step. It involves assessing candidates’ personal skills like their values, work ethics, passions etc. apart from their professional skillset. Executive interviews are a whole different ballgame than regular interviews. Even though it’s a tedious process, this step confirms both to the organization and the candidate if they are the right fit and proves to be extremely worth it in the longer run.\nAt The Taplow Group we help you source the best-fit for your organization’s leadership through our global \n executive search consultants.\n To know more about our services like leadership coaching, professional hiring, management consulting, reach out to us at \n www.taplowgroup.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (7281)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

The practice over time became an intrinsic part of manufacturers “Lean Manufacturing” techniques.\n\n\n\r\nRather than making large batches of parts at a time, automotive manufacturers sought to produce them at a rate that matched demand. Just-in-time was inspired by observing an American supermarket, where a customer took the desired amount of goods from the shelf and the store restocked with just enough to fill the space.\n\n\n\r\nThe original rationale for just-in-time: Catch quality problems early before you have a lot of defective parts made, lessen the risk of obsolescence. Don’t waste space storing and managing all that inventory, lessen the amount of cash tied up in parts and stock.\n\n\n \n\n\nJust in Case.\n\n\nJust-in-case (JIC) is a stock control method that involves producing or purchasing stock with excess, or buffer stock in place. This means that there is always stock available for the business if required. JIC is very useful when there is a shortage of a certain product, or a sudden increase in demand for a particular product.\n\n\n\r\nThe pandemic has shone a light on how globally interconnected supply chains and logistics are, and the weakness of a rigid JIT system. Many companies have been adversely impacted by not being able to locate or order parts, meaning their production slows or even worse has to temporarily cease.\n\n\n \n\n\nAre hybrid solutions the way forward?\n\n\nMany manufacturers have either reverted to holding buffer stock parts or as is more the case, asking suppliers to have more local warehouses and logistic facilities, thus keeping elements of a company’s JIT system operable.\n\n\n\r\nManufacturers, like the service sector, who utilise a hybrid work from home/ office base employee system, are seeing hybrid solutions as the way forward rather than one rigid system as the preferred solution. A mixture of JIT, JIC and last mile logistics abilities are the optimum solution, to ensure supplier parts and their companies cashflows are not severely impacted by local/ regional lockdowns or long-distance logistic disruption.\n\n\n\r\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (4177)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

It is no longer viewed as a moral imperative but rather seen as a source of competitive advantage. Diverse leaders would bring new ideas to the table, broaden the horizon, and achieve better results. It also increases employee morale and motivation when they see a diverse set of leaders leading the organization. No doubt, diversity in the workplace is a top criterion for employees in selecting their workplace.\n\n\n\r\nBut how do you bring diversity to leadership? Seems like moving mountains! However, if you partner with the best\n\n\nglobal executive search consultants firm\n, then things become easy, and you can rely on our search services for the best results.\n\n\n\r\nBefore you dive into headhunting, let us unfold the nuances of diversity in leadership for any business organization –\n\n\n\n\nDiversity efforts have milestones, not destination\n\r\nTo create a truly diverse work culture, you need effort, time, commitment, and patience. This will not happen overnight. It should be a continuous journey and not a one-time effort. Even if you are not hiring right now, build your pipeline, connect and establish relationships with a diverse set of people. At the same time, invest in your internal resources, so that you can establish a culture of diversity and inclusion within the organization.\n\n\n\n\nThe first impression matters\n\r\nInterviews allow candidates to create a lasting first impression, however, the reverse is very true indeed. It gives candidates a chance to evaluate the organization and gives him/her a picture of what is in store for the future. Do you allow flexibility in the process? Do you provide timely feedback and the overall process adds value to the candidate? Do you share timely communication?\n\n\n\r\nBeyond the hiring, think about the onboarding process. It has to be smooth, and the candidate must receive the necessary handholding to thrive in the role.\n\n\n\n\nKeep the human factor alive\n\r\nYou might use a tool of tools and software to screen resumes, and determine cultural fitness, and technical competencies. But, remember at the end of the day, the person is a human. Get to know the person, and his/her background, and give the candidate ample scope to present what values he/she can bring to the table. This is where the expertise of a \n global executive search\n comes into the picture. These experts know the market well and will scout the best candidates, even those that miss your radar.\n\n\n\n\nWhere do you see yourself in the next two years?\n\r\nLove this question? Must have asked every new joiner! But what about the organization? Does the organization have a vision for itself, is there a strategy and structure in place? New candidates would evaluate these parameters before joining and well-defined business processes and strategies will help you attract and hire diverse leaders for your organization.\n\n\n\r\nWe are living in the world of the metaverse. Break the conventions and embrace diversity. A diverse team equals great organization and exceptional performance, lending the competitive edge over others in the market.

Shoving it under the carpet can have dire results. Poor mental health can lead to employees’ either quitting unannounced or taking long leaves of absence, both of which greatly hinder the organization’s functioning.\n\r\nEmployees’ mental health needs to be prioritized and awareness regarding the same needs to be raised.\n\n\n\r\nLeaders must pave the way towards important mental health discussions at workplace. Some ways in which this can be practiced and implemented are :-\n\n\n \n\n\nEnsure top level management onboard\n\n\nIn order to properly take care of your employees’ mental health, you need to ensure you have the management’s full support and approval that translates into funds being allocated for mental health initiatives. By raising awareness around how mental health benefits the organization, you can ensure management is well invested in everyone’s well-being.\n\n\n \n\n\nMental health awareness should be across all levels\n\n\nLeaders and managers need to keep an eye on the employees and spot signs of potential mental health challenges to fix the problem before it grows troublesome. You should keep a check on signs of struggles based on behavioral changes, productivity levels and overall body language as well as attitude differences. Leaders should also prioritize their mental health issues as they are also as vulnerable as anyone else.\n\n\n \n\n\nEncourage conversations about mental health and speaking up about struggles associated\n\n\nSimply implementing mental health initiatives isn’t enough as it won’t bring about any real change till people speak up and feel safe. They have to feel safe and be confident that their mental health is cared for by the leaders, HR and managers. One needs to regularly engage with their employees and offer the needed support. Supportive measures need to specially revolve around having a healthy work-life balance. Clear guidelines should be established around accessing support and there should be multiple avenues for the same.\n\n\n \n\n\nCheck in regularly and be the role model\n\n\nRegular check-ins should be standard practice and can be done in a variety of ways, such as one on one conversations, or having a support portal. Ask the kind of support that they require and make sure they’re given it in a feasible manner. If top tier management and leaders speak out about their mental health struggles and share personal experiences, it motivates employees to do the same. Clear workload boundaries also go a long way. Most importantly, you should be kind, understanding and mindful while conducting these sensitive conversations.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (4010)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

This value is assessed with the help of their skillset, knowledge, and abilities. According to several surveys, most companies don’t invest properly in Human Capital Development and don’t focus on it as much as they should. \n Human capital development\n doesn’t just translate in increased profits but also benefits the organization immensely in the longer run. A specialist human capital services firm can help organizations realize the value of human capital development and shift focus to it.\nHere are some of the most important benefits of investing in Human Capital Development are:\n1. Contribute Towards Higher Employee Satisfaction And Retention Rates\nInvesting in \n human capital development\n leads to employees feeling valued and cared for, which in turn leads to employee satisfaction. An organization’s commitment to human capital development using the right tools shows all the people working for the organization that the business cares about the professional growth of all individuals contributing. Career development opportunities also contribute to higher retention rates. Studies have reflected that employees prefer opportunities for growth and advancements over salary hikes. People who are constantly being trained and their skillset being polished and improved, experience less work stress and anxiety and are more loyal to the organization providing such opportunities.\n2. Increased Employee Engagement \nEvery business with high employee engagement thrives. Engagement amongst employees leads to more productivity and loyalty. \n Human Capital Development\n gives employees the right motivation to stay engaged and focused. It also drives them towards a common goal which is overall success of the organization.\n3. Better ROI\nEvery organization consciously or unconsciously invests in human capital, since salaries, benefits, perks etc. all are a form of \n human capital\n investment. Since every company is actively investing in human capital in one way or another, you might as well spend a little more towards human capital development and get the results you need. A good proportion of profits should be dedicated towards betterment of the employees in order to maximize your ROI. Opportunities for growth and learning will ultimately improve your bottom-line.\n4. More Effective Recruiting \nAs mentioned above, focusing on human capital development leads to higher retention rates. At the same time, it also helps you hire better people for the organization. It looks extremely attractive to potential candidates, especially millennials, when the company believes in helping your career grow and provides opportunities for the same by allocating significant resources towards human capital search and development.\n Human capital services\n display a company’s commitment to its employees.\n5. Thriving Work Culture\nIncreased employee satisfaction, communication and engagement leads to a more positive and healthy work environment. All these learning and growth opportunities not only inspire employees but also motivate them to be more present at work. A positive culture leads to people being more productive on a daily basis and showing up happy to work.\nAt The Taplow Group we not only help you source the best-fit for your organization’s leadership through our executive search consultants but also train and develop them to hone their skills.

Interesting, isn’t it? Especially in today’s time when \n Human Capital\n forms the most important pillar in an organization’s success story. Human Capital can be developed and nurtured via education and the right training techniques which help take the organization forward. Every employee has a unique skillset which contributes to the economic capital of a company. Human capital is intangible and cannot be quantified on a balance sheet but is equally important as it helps organizations grow and promote their concerned services or products.\nHuman Capital is improved by investing in the training, skills, loyalty, motivation, and wellbeing of employees at every level. When employees work towards refining and broadening their skillset, they increase their earning potential but that doesn’t necessarily translate into benefitting the organization. For that, companies need to invest in and manage their human capital in order to witness higher productivity levels and increase profitability.\nHuman capital management can prove to be tricky and that’s where our human capital consultancy services come into play. We consult with you and come up with measures to improve your human capital which then translates into organizational success. Here are some useful tips to improve\n human capital management \n in your organization:\n1. Shift the focus to retention from recruiting \nNew talent is a key factor in driving any company forward, but existing employees are equally important and relevant. A company should never solely focus on recruiting and onboarding because that leads to existing people feeling undervalued and ignored. Employee attrition is extremely significant and is driven from the happiness and engagement level of employees. There should be a smart and practical employee recognition, review and learning process in place that makes all your human capital feel valued and appreciated. Are you struggling with your retention rates? Our human capital consultancy services can help you devise a customized strategy.\n2. One on One connect with each employee\nAlways keep in mind that every employee is equally relevant and can play an important role towards driving growth of the organization. When it comes to day-to-day management of employees, a personal approach goes a long way. Taking into account everyone’s individual personalities and preferences can help you cater to their needs in a more effective manner. There is no fixed handbook for \n human capital management\n, so techniques and initiatives should be reevaluated frequently for them to be effective and beneficial in the longer run.\n3. Proper technology goes a long way\nThe right technology plays a very important role in efficient human capital management processes. Automated processes help cover a larger base and reduce workload on HR professionals. Technology also helps drive the right culture. Experienced consultants at our \n human capital consultancy services\n can help you choose the best tech solution to meet your needs.\n4. Communication is key\nLeaders should ensure that all the important decisions and changes are communicated properly to employees at all levels, or employees that are prone to be affected by the said changes at the very least, instead of trickling down inaccurately through the rumor mill. This helps build trust. This being said, effective communication goes way beyond periods of transition. It should be practiced constantly. Two-way communication should be encouraged and appreciated. Open communication helps employees feel more at home and ensures they voice out their concerns. Being heard can make a huge difference to one’s loyalty and helps them stay engaged and productive. Effective communication helps indicate that the company has everyone’s interests at heart.\nAny business’s most critical asset is its people, and more and more organizations are realizing this and therefore are increasing their focus towards human capital management and investing in \n human capital consultancy services.\n At The Taplow Group we not only help you source the best fit for your organization’s leadership through our executive search consultants but also train and develop them to hone their skills.

This is proof enough that gender equality is not just a social or moral imperative, but also an economic necessity. \nThe good news is that organizations are increasingly realizing that by including women in their workforce, they are not just gaining competitive advantage but also improving their profits. There are many arguments that exist for increasing the focus around closing the gender gap, but the most compelling is the growing body of research showing gender-diverse organizations are more successful across all metrics.\nRecent research indicates that Fortune 500 companies with at least three  women on their board of directors increased sales by 42%, increased ROI by 66%, and experienced a ROE of 53%.\nA survey by Carnegie Mellon University found that teams with at least one female member had a collectively higher IQ than teams with only men.\nOpening doors to women today means opening doors to the future. However, for driving change and making real diversity and inclusion progress, it’s imperative for organizations to have the right levels of leadership commitment and accountability. Getting diversity governance right is the first step in this direction. It would help to make gender equality truly sustainable in business practices by overcoming the resistance and concerns about women’s limited progress within the workplace structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2655)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

According to LHH's Readiness Index, this generation has severe work and career related anxiety as the onset of their respective careers and first jobs have been in a hybrid working environment and thus the lack of in-person connections. This anxiety stems from uncertainty about their skillsets and confusion about how to correctly utilize them.\nThanks to the huge upheaval in the work environment in the last 2 years, majority of Gen Z has never had the opportunity to experience a physical work environment and fails to prosper from the WFH model unlike senior and more experienced professionals. Working from an office is a far more superior and wholesome working environment for those just starting out as it presents young individuals with the opportunity to witness the magic happen and build meaningful connections with their peers and managers. It’s extremely difficult to translate the same learning experience via zoom calls and email thread communications. Earlier, career trainings were reserved mostly for senior management and future leaders. However, the need of the hour is to train this plethora of fresh talent that is beginning their professional journeys in such an uncertain environment.\nLHH's Readiness Index also states that 34% of the population between 18 and 24 were insecure of their existing skillset adding value to their roles, 33% were confused about what the next step is in their career growth and an alarming 55% were unable to figure out how to take the next step. Career training at an early stage will not just help relieve career related anxiety but also provide the much-needed guidance on how to utilize their skillsets and navigate their career paths.\nA lot of experienced and successful people are often found pondering how their careers and work life would’ve shaped had they been provided career training in the beginning. In order to avoid making the same mistakes with Gen Z, career training is a must to raise awareness, decrease and manage stress level by increasing knowledge, which in turn will translate to individuals discovering and honing their skills, developing resilience, grit and tenacity that will help them in the long run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2237)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

This is perhaps one of the most often-asked question about leadership. The work environment is constantly evolving and in order to keep up with these changes, an organization needs a leader capable of adapting to change and ensuring that the organization thrives in every circumstance. In order to equip the executive staff of organizations with the necessary skills to achieve this seamlessly, \n certified CEO training programs\n also need to be constantly evolving and stay ahead of the curve. A good and relevant executive training program recognizes the benefits of having a CEO who is capable of handling and thriving in this VUCA world and hence focuses on newer training techniques rather than plain old skills refreshers.\nLeaders today first need to focus on their own self growth and prioritize self-development before contributing to the organization’s growth. By honing their own skills and having a relevant skillset they ensure that their organization grows in the desired direction and achieves success. Over the last couple of years, not only have the key requirements and expectations from a CEO changed, but also the method of operation has undergone a transformation. \n Good CEO search services\n recognize this change well and have altered their techniques and methodology accordingly to deliver this.\nCEOs of today and tomorrow constantly operate in an environment fueled by slowing world economy and volatile geopolitical situations that come with it. The focus has shifted greatly to environmental, social, and corporate governance issues which come with added responsibility. It is far more important for an executive leader to now take into account not only all stakeholders but also employees at every level while calling the shots, which is somewhat a challenge in itself. Technology is changing as we speak in manners, we can’t even fathom yet. \n CEO search services \n also acknowledge that this change requires leaders need to be well versed with data analytics and machine learning in order to come up with more progressive and beneficial business models that help the organization stay innovative and relevant.\nTraditional left skills such as logic or technical expertise no longer make the cut when it comes to CEO candidates. Today, people oriented skills, high EQ along with other softer right brain attributes are just as necessary. Along with the correct skillset, our \n CEO search services\n also focuses on finding and developing candidates that have the right attitude. Since CEOs are constantly learning on the job, they need the right attitude towards adaptability and change. One needs to be open minded and have the capability to self-introspect from time to time in order to correct possible errors in decision making amongst other aspects. \n CEO recruiters\n now focus on the candidates developing the right mindset to ensure it’s in sync with the company’s vision. A good EQ helps significantly in building a team that feels empowered enough to work towards the overall growth of the organization in all relevant aspects.\nIt’s important that CEOs of today are trained for the job rather than just falling into it merely after years of experience followed by a generous promotion. Our CEO Institute offers \n Certified CEO Training Program\n that gives a head start to an individual’s learning journey.

The usual questions are: What factors should you consider? How to structure it correctly? How do you align it with business goals and group performance? It is indeed a difficult task to comprehend all the elements and then design a great executive compensation package.\nNo matter how difficult it may sound, it is extremely important to get it right. The top executives in your organization are responsible for preparing the strategies, implementing them, and ensuring that you are on the growth trajectory. Additionally, these packages are often scrutinized by the board, regulatory bodies, and other interested parties. This package plays a pivotal role in retaining top executives and maintaining stability.\nIt might be a challenge, but it is not an impossible task. If you understand the components that go into this compensation and then follow a stepwise approach, it becomes simpler! Multiple components go into this package – fixed pay, performance-linked pay, stock options, perks, medical and family welfare benefits, retirement plans, and other such benefits.\nTo design a sustainable executive compensation package, you need to identify your corporate goals followed by benchmarking the current package with the industry standards. Get all the involved stakeholders on board, take their opinion, and decide who would be eligible for this package. Once finalized, make sure you document and communicate the same with the concerned party. Remember this is not a one-time activity, come back and revise the plan to continuously meet the changing business landscape and organizational needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3068)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Does it surprise you to see people who are responsible for hiring and firing, planning organizational events, seminars, and welfare activities going up the ladder to the top? If yes, then it is high time we dissolve the myth and accept the fact that CHROs are strong contenders to becoming great CEOs.\nThere is this common notion that CEOs come from finance, marketing, or operations background. You need technical skills, industry knowledge and not people skills to become the captain of the ship. Gone are those days! The way business dynamics are evolving each day, it is very critical to understand and manage your human resources. People skills are as important as industry knowledge. In this VUCA world, the new normal, businesses are focusing on their human capital more than their profits. Emotional quotient and people skills are climbing the ladder, becoming top requirements to become CEO in the modern times.\nHaving said all this, it is also equally important for HR professionals to come out of their comfort zone. They need to set their aspiration high and then groom themselves accordingly. The world is changing and the new normal is here to stay where employee engagement and corporate culture are at the center of organizational priorities.

As economies and businesses are trying to offset the impact of these events, human capital and investments around human capital development are likely to take a center seat. Right from accessing and hiring the right talent to build a resilient and digital-ready organization, \n human capital development\n is going to be the key.\nThe new normal is likely to witness the hybrid working model. Although this is a positive change, the new working model would restructure the existing organizational culture. Therefore, organizations should look to create an employee-centric work culture that is in line with the core values of the organization as well as adaptable to both in-office and remote working. Organizational structures would change and become more flexible. The ultimate goal would be productivity and performance, but employees would feel more inclusive and valued. All these changes would be done keeping in mind the safety protocols, and here we are talking about both physical and mental well-being.\nEmployees have gone through a lot of uncertainties and distress during the pandemic. Organizations should stand beside them and think about restructuring compensations based on market dynamics. It is no longer about the number of hours spent, rather it has now become an outcome-based model where incentives and pay are directly linked with productivity and output. Productivity can be enhanced further when you take care of your employees’ professional growth. Help in upskilling their competencies and make them more future-ready. This will benefit both the organization as well as the employees – a win-win situation for both parties.\nA very valuable ally that has helped organizations transform and adapt to the new normal is data and analytics. Sounds technical, right? But data and analytics have immense potential when it comes to human capital development. What are the market realities for compensations? How to monitor and measure workforce productivity? What are the gaps that need immediate attention? Yes, data and insights gathered from data can help you drive answers. HR analytics will help you stay competitive in the modern business world. You can optimize your \n human capital development\n by adequate resource allocation, analyzing employee performance, and make data-driven decisions to decide on the future strategy of the organization.\nUse technology and insights from data for optimizing \n human capital search services.\n Tap into a diverse skill set, access a wide pool of candidates, and reduce hiring costs by adopting a digital-first hiring strategy. You can use AI/ML for resume scanning, cultural fitment tests, conducting background verification, and laying the foundation of high value-driven decision-making within the organization.\nThe whole world is evolving and gearing up to embrace the new normal, and it is talking about ‘digital today’ and not tomorrow. Human capital search is no exception. Integrate disruptive technologies, digital tools, and the latest equipment to accelerate this digital transformation, this journey toward becoming truly data driven. The new normal is here and it is shaping the future of \n human capital services.\n Let us act now, live with it, and make the most of it.\nAt The Taplow Group we not only help you source the best-fit for your organization’s leadership through our executive search consultants but also train and develop them to hone their skills.

According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) a record 4.3 million people resigned in August 2021. Is it largely been fuelled by burnout? Or other factors like the shift to working from home and the need to move into a more stable, better paying profession is behind this exodus?\nI have been thinking long and hard about it and here is my take on this phenomenon that has literally taken the world by a storm.\nAre executives across all levels a part of this?\nThe Great Resignation hasn’t really affected “Senior Management opportunities” to the level of supervisory/ operatives or administrative levels. This is partly due to senior managers staying in situ longer. Their retirement pensions or shareholding were adversely affected during the pandemic, leading to many deferring retiring. Also, as companies “battened down the hatches” in the pandemic or put growth plans on hiatus, companies didn’t seek to bring in new senior managers.\nThe Great Resignation or the Great Reconfiguration?\nA large swath of workers is simply reconfiguring what their careers look like. This is driven by people experiencing a different work/ life balance and having a “pandemic epiphany.”\nThe Great Resignation or The Great Reshuffle?\nThis is being driven by companies coming out of their pandemic blues and focusing on growth and new strategies. Therefore, the number of vacancies has risen significantly in the past 6 months.\nWho is more likely to move?\nEmployees, particularly “Generation Z” are more likely to move roles. This had ceased during the pandemic and now economies are emerging from the imposed lockdown, Employees are once again being tempted to move.\nIs Inflation driving the Great Resignation?\nIn the past 6 months, inflation in numerous economies has risen considerably and has yet to peak. With inflationary pressures affecting disposable income, many employees are looking at alternate employers in sectors where salary levels are traditionally higher.\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (5050)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

As the business world is trying to offset the impact of the events of the last couple of years, concerns around the mode of work have emerged. Will it be work from the office like earlier times, completely remote, or a hybrid model?\nThe remote working has enhanced productivity for employees, helped them stay closer and more connected with family members, and save time on commuting. However, work from home has introduced ‘zoom fatigue’, created disconnects between colleagues, and has made it difficult for new employees to adjust to the organizational culture. Hence, the hybrid model seems to be the future.\nThe hybrid model of work will undoubtedly result in cost savings for both the organization and the employees. It will boost both mental and physical health for employees as they stay closer to family. This model also enhances the idea of diversity and inclusion as organizations can recruit people across the globe and tap into the differently abled talent pool as well.\nNow flip the coin! Think about industries like healthcare, agriculture, or manufacturing! It has been and will always remain areas where you must be physically present, restricting the adoption of the hybrid model. We can safely conclude that as we move ahead into 2022, the hybrid model is here to stay. This model offers the best of both worlds like, employees can visit offices, meet associates in person, and collaborate with teams as much as possible and at the same time work from home 2-3 days in a week. However, we will need to wait and watch how the situation evolves in the next few months and take a call accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2200)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

These are intangible assets, yet very critical and cannot be easily duplicated.\nSince these are intangible assets, it is very difficult to plan, strategize, and implement them. Hence, you need a reliable partner, a trusted \n human capital search\n service to help you build your capabilities and strength. Before looking into how to strengthen these capabilities, let us understand the importance of organizational capabilities –\n1. When you manage your resources effectively and meet customer demands with the right set of services and products, you are already one step ahead of the competition. This will help you surpass your competitors and increase your market share\n2. If you have invested in building great organizational capabilities, then you give resilience and strength to your business to tackle unprecedented times. An organization that manages its customers, employees, and resources can forecast trends and steer through uncertain times\n3. At the end of the day, it all comes down to the bottom line. If you have managed resources well, have happy customers, and productive employees, then it would surely reflect your bottom line. Historically, all those organizations that have invested in building their capabilities have reaped great profits. Hiring a human resource consulting firm is a great step in this direction.\nHow do you cultivate and strengthen organizational capabilities? Will it transform overnight? The answer is NO; Our human capital consultancy services can help you build leadership, innovation, and agility and gain prominence in the business world –\nLeadership engagement\nThis is something that has to be driven right from the top to the last mile salesforce. Leaders have to be aligned, they need to understand the importance of these, and what is the result they can expect. It should start with an impact-driven strategy and a well-planned roadmap in place.\nPrioritize organizational capabilities\nIt would be similar to moving mountains if you want to accelerate on all fronts of organizational capabilities. Figure out which ones are the most important according to your corporate goals and vision. Start small, build on that, and then use your learning curve to implement the others incrementally and continuously.\nMeasure performance\nThere is no universal set of metrics that can measure all the organizational capabilities. They vary based on industry, organization size, business practices, and leadership styles. This calls for a discussion between board members, top leaders, and consultants from external human capital management services. Define metrics and accountability and then track progress on these initiatives.\nBridge the talent gap\nAt the end of the day, it’s your human capital that drives your financial capital. Find out the gaps, be it in leadership, business units, or even last-mile salesforce. Then partner with \n human capital search\n consultants to access and identify the best set of talent. Bring them on board and build your capabilities on top of their competencies and expertise.\nOrganizational capabilities impact your performance and client relations.

One common practice is either an employee gets vaccinated or gives consent to get tested at regular intervals. Organizations are doing everything, right from offering incentives to paid time off to increase the vaccination rates. The idea is to create safe workplaces for people to come back to their physical workplaces.\nTwo of the biggest roadblocks in people getting vaccinated are pre-existing medical conditions or sincerely held religious beliefs. While vaccine mandates have sparked protests and lawsuits, research indicates that these mandates are leading to an increase in vaccination rates. Workplace mandates have especially encouraged those employees to get a shot who were sitting on the fence to get a shot. The widespread and contagious nature of this virus has forced organizations to consider vaccine mandates to protect their employees and deal with any worker shortages due to prolonged illness.\nWhen asked, leaders have replied favorably that getting vaccinated has made a huge difference in the health and safety of their workforce, and there has been a significant decline in the number of cases organization wide. On the other hand some have said that such mandates are likely to cause workers to leave their jobs at a time when finding new employees already is difficult.​​ However, as per the latest update the Supreme Court in the United States has stopped the Biden administration from enforcing a requirement that employees at large businesses be vaccinated against COVID-19 or undergo weekly testing and wear a mask on the job with the exception of healthcare workers. Currently, the best way is to keep up your safety measures and stay safe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2133)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

It created a unique ‘new normal’ where water cooler conversations and coffee breaks got replaced with Zoom or Teams meetings. This radically different business landscape forced leaders to think in a different way and focus more on how they can help their employees thrive during these unprecedented times. Organizations started transitioning from being financial enterprises to social enterprises, focusing on employee wellbeing, growth, care for the family, and support to survive the complex wave of disruption.\nHow can you manage through disruptions? A reputed and reliable human resource consulting firm can become your greatest ally. Let us elaborate on how you can lead during these difficult times –\nLead with empathy\nAn employee-centric culture and mode of communication are imperative during these times. When you lead with humanity and compassion, it creates an environment where everyone feels cared for. Conversations should not only be about performance and business goals, but also about individual challenges, mental well-being, and personal development. Your team members are anxious and stressed, you need to become their friend and help them ease out by leading with empathy.\nRemove biases and enhance inclusivity\nEven in the best organizations, there are biases when it comes to performance evaluations or exchanging feedback. These challenges can get aggravated with the new models of working and led to reduced employee morale and productivity. As leaders, you need to strive to remove all sorts of biases – based on personality, confirmation, or even affinity. Replace biases with collaborative efforts, seek diverse ideas, and thus promote inclusivity within the organization.\nPromote belongingness\nIt is crucial that your employees feel safe and have a feeling of belongingness for their workplace. It might be difficult to cultivate that with the remote model of work, but it is not impossible. Instead of physical lunch outings, you can have virtual ones. There can be celebrations around achievements in personal and professional lives. You can think about workout sessions, fun sessions, quizzes, and games to engage employees and cultivate a sense of belongingness.\nHear the voices\nCommunication cannot be a one-way process. When you share feedback about performance you should also ask about your employee’s needs and perspectives. The employee pulse surveys should not be done just for compliance but for improving processes and culture within the organization. As managers and leaders, solicit feedback from employees and then implement them into reality.\nGratitude is the best attitude\nYour employees do not work just for the paycheck. Though that might be the tangible end product, they also look for appreciation and gratitude. A ‘Thank you note on LinkedIn, or the company website can work wonders to motivate your fellow colleagues and employees. Today’s workforce needs appreciation now more than ever, for helping you run your business amidst these disruptions. Say ‘thank you often and make it a practice within the organization.\nDisruptions are difficult but if you have the best human capital consultancy services with you, then you can become resilient and future-ready to manage difficult times successfully.

We help you build dynamic plans that allow you to revisit strategies and reallocate human capital based on market conditions and the workforce performance.\n \nRedefining Employee Experience\n \nLast couple of years have fundamentally and irrevocably altered the employee experience.

Flexibility in work hours, independence in choosing work location, paid time offs, caregiving leaves, and opportunities for career breaks are some of the options that come under flexibility.

A majority of the businesses would cite talent acquisition as the major concern, specifically focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). It is indeed an overwhelming task to find top talent and more so finding top talent from underrepresented communities or geographies. The game becomes even more complex when it comes to retaining diverse talent. Where to go for help?\n Global executive search\n services can be the best approach to enhance your talent management process. The entire process, starting from hiring to performance management and succession planning needs a major overhaul to include diversity and equity in your workforce. The professional executives would help you identify biases, remove barriers to making the change, and then devise a long-term diversity hiring strategy.\nThere are several ways that can help you enhance your workforce diversity; here are the top five -\nDefine clear job requirements\nAre you looking for candidates with the perfect resume? It is almost a utopia in the world of hiring. You must first rethink what competencies and skills are required for the position and then redefine the job description and qualifications needed.\nBecome neutral in your communication\nAn essential way to fast-track your workplace DEI is to become gender neutral. Eliminate the use of he or she from job descriptions and official documents. Try to make roles as gender neutral as possible. The latest application tracking systems (ATS) can filter resumes and eliminate biases. You can take things further by deploying algorithms that can filter resumes based on keywords relevant to the job description.\nCheck for cultural fitment\nIt is not necessary for you to go for the most technologically sound and skillful person. Yes, you have read it right! Cultural fitment is way more important than any skills or competencies. Learn to evaluate how a candidate would work by himself and within a team, whether the person resonates with the company values or can adopt the way of working in a short period of time. \n Our Global executive search\n services can help you shortlist the best candidate.\nEliminate recruitment biases\n Professional recruitment consultants\n will help you identify biases in your hiring, promotion, and retention processes. You should opt for a standardized process, ask the same questions to all candidates, irrespective of the background of the candidate. Try and avoid self-evaluating questions and have a diverse recruitment panel, ideally a group of people from different cultures, ethnicity, and seniority.\nTrain your internal workforce\nYou should conduct inclusion training within your organization to help people identify and eliminate biases and be more open-minded when it comes to hiring new talent. DEI is not only limited to hiring but it should be something practiced within the organization during performance reviews, promotions, and internal communications.\nIf you want to infuse DEI within the DNA of your organization, then you should partner with the best global executive search consultants firm today and maximize your efforts around the strategies to fast-track your workplace diversity, equity, and inclusion.\nAt The Taplow Group we help you source the best-fit for your organization’s leadership through our \n global executive search consultants.\n To know more about our services like leadership coaching, professional hiring, management consulting, reach out to us at \n www.taplowgroup.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2649)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

The answer must be a resounding yes, but followed by a big question mark – How to become an effective CEO? In search of this answer, you will soon realize that ambition alone will not take you there. Along with ambition and determination, you need few skills and competencies to be on the top of your game.\n \nThe list begins with the ability to generate results. Are you able to bring in results as per the expectations set for you – the numbers will speak for themselves. At the same time, the CEO is responsible for enriching the organization’s culture, drive innovation, and motivate employees to perform beyond the set typical expectancy.\n \nAre you able to attract great talent and groom new leaders? Are you a successful negotiator? If yes, then add these two feathers to your competencies in becoming an effective CEO. A CEO is responsible to analyze the present market, anticipate the future, and thereby formulate strategies that will steer the organization ahead of its competitors.\n \nA CEO should be a visionary. Every single professional aspires to become a CEO but only a meagre handful of people succeeds in becoming and even smaller percentage becomes great CEOs. The difference lies in identifying these competencies, working on them, and becoming better and better each day.

    "content": "Top 5 Challenges of C- Suite Sourcing in 2022\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nWednesday, February 2, 2022\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nC-suite sourcing is very complex, and you cannot afford to make mistakes because it might cost you dearly. At the same time, with the business landscape becoming so dynamic, you cannot follow old notions of CEOs coming and settling in and growing with the brand. C-suite employees must be agile, flexible, updated with the market changes, and should be able to quickly blend in with the organization and its culture. More and more organizations are opting for \nCEO search services\n to hire the best for their C-suite positions. In this respect, having clarity around the challenges that you might face in the C-suite recruitment will help you prepare better in your recruitment strategies.\n \nUnderstand your competition\n \nIt is a candidate-driven market, and the best candidates won’t take long to switch over to your competitor’s offer if your offer is not good enough. Thus, you should be aware of what compensation your competition is offering. Can you go beyond that or offer more perks and benefits to the candidate? Your remuneration, perks, work culture, and values should be strong enough so that every candidate would look forward to joining you.\n \nMillennials climbing ranks\n \nWith millennials and the Gen-Z climbing the ladder and ending up with C-suite positions, you must be aware of their expectations and their way of working. Most of them tend to do away with the hierarchical approach and adopt a flat organizational approach. Are you ready to challenge your present ways of working and accommodate these changes?\n \nGroom leaders of tomorrow\n \nWith old members stepping down and young ones climbing up the ladder to C-suite positions, you need to ensure that they are well-groomed to do justice to these roles. Here you should not take chances and always go for the best-certified CEO training programs to develop skills within the workforce and groom the leaders of tomorrow. The CEO certification programs are custom-designed based on your industry, size of organization, culture, mission, and the expectations from the new C-suite members.\n \nDiversity\n \nDiversity in top leadership is no longer a novelty but has become a regulatory mandate across many countries. Can you drop some of the traditional biases and welcome more and more diversity and inclusivity? Be it in terms of gender ratio or regional representations, diversity in the team will enhance innovation and bring in creative ideas, which in turn is directly related to the performance of your organization.\n \nYour location\n \nThe location of an organization used to be a major factor earlier but with greater adoption of remote working models, this has become a minor challenge as compared to the others. In case you need C-suite employees at a particular location, then you need to consider relocation assistance, accommodation help, and everything that would help an employee set up and live a fulfilling life.\nAt The Taplow Group we help you source the best-fit CEO for your organization through our \nCEO search services\n.

    "content": "5 Ways Leaders Can Drive Successful Employee Development Programs\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nThursday, January 27, 2022\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 3.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe modern workplace has become dynamic, and it is now transitioning from an employer-driven ecosystem to an employee-driven ecosystem. This means, that, employers cannot take employee loyalty for granted. CEOs and business leaders need to identify ways through which they can drive successful employee development programs. It requires a lot of thought and brainstorming to develop a well-suited and sustainable employee development strategy. Our \n certified CEO training program\n will help your leaders and CEOs design engagement and development programs for the workforce.\nYour leaders can look to apply some of these strategies to drive growth and development for your employees –\nUnderstand goals and aspirations\nWith the remote and hybrid mode of work, communication has become an essential cornerstone for employee engagement. Leaders must have one-on-one interaction with their workforce and understand their professional goals and aspirations. At the same time, help them identify milestones in their professional journey and provide them the resources that can support them in this journey. In this way your employees would feel valued, resulting in greater loyalty and productivity.\nArrange for training programs\nOnce you have identified and prepared a career plan for your employees, you need to now arrange for training sessions to help them develop new skills and competencies. These programs need to be arranged both at a group level as well as at individual levels. With virtual learning attending seminars, conferences, and video lectures has been very easy and employees can learn at their own pace. Make sure you also help your workforce get updated with what’s happening around the industry as well and share learnings with the wider audience in the organization.\nRotate job roles\nVariety is the spice of life, and it is very true for your workforce as well. Try to rotate your employees in different job roles, maybe within the same department or business unit. This would help them develop new skills, take an active interest in work, and appreciate the work done by fellow employees. Job rotation will not only increase employee productivity but also promote greater collaboration within the organization.\nSupport work-life balance\nAlmost every \n CEO certification program\n will now stress work-life balance. The last two years have highlighted the importance of mental health, time spent with family, and devoting time to hobbies and interests. As a manager or CEO, you need to ensure that your employees are not burning themselves at work and they are encouraged to take time off, spend time with family, or pursue any hobby of their choice.\nCreate and share succession plans\nEvery employee wants to see themselves climbing the ladder. Hence, create a succession plan and show your employees how you plan to involve them in the leadership of the organization. \n CEO recruiters\n focus a lot on the ability to develop succession plans for modern-day CEOs. This will ensure that your employees take more interest in their work, business activities, and become closely aligned with the mission and vision of the organization.\nEmployee development programs give employees something in return for their work and service. A carefully thought-out plan can result in tremendous productivity and loyalty from your employees.\nAt The Taplow Group we help you source the best-fit for your organization’s leadership through our \n executive search consultants\n.

    "content": "2022 Global Business Outlook Report\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nThursday, January 20, 2022\n/\nCategories: \nNews\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nThe Taplow Group S.A. with 20 partner firms, located across 6 continents. Our expert consultants bring a wealth of expertise in their Countries whilst effortlessly combining internationally. We combine to bring business leaders economic and business information.\n\n\n \n\n\nASIA\n\n\nAustralia \n\n\nEconomic Outlook:\nThe Australian Federal Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, revealed during Thursday’s mid-year budget update that Australia’s unemployment rate will fall comfortably below 5% in 2022 as the economy continues to rebound.\n\n\n\r\nAfter many months of volatile unemployment figures due to lockdowns and falling participation rates, the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (MYEFO) will forecast the unemployment rate to drop to 4.5% in the June quarter of next year.\n\n\n\r\nThis is down from the 5% unemployment rate forecast for June 2022 in the May budget.\n\r\nIn 2022-23, the unemployment rate will fall again to 4.25%, slightly below the 4.75% previously forecast, and the lowest level since September 2008.\n\n\n\r\nBy 2024-25, an extra million jobs are expected to be added to the economy, as growth rates return to pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\n\r\nThe Treasurer highlighted the unemployment rate as being sustained below 5% for the first time since before the global financial crisis and only the second time since the early 1970s.\n\n\n\r\nAustralia last had a run of unemployment below 5% from 2006 to 2009. More than $A 13bn has been paid in pandemic support payments since the Covid pandemic began for more than 6m claims, mainly as Covid disaster payments.\n\n\n\r\nThe improved unemployment rate – which refers to the share of the labour force that is without work and seeking employment – suggests an extra 150,000 people will be employed by 2024-25 across the economy than forecast in the May 2021-22 budgets.\n\n\n\r\nMYEFO documents will also show that Treasury expects to see the creation of 1m jobs over the forward estimates with a total of more than 13.8 million people employed by June 2025.\n\n\n\r\nThe strong jobs growth will see a record high employment to population ratio of 63.1% by the September quarter next year. (Source Federal Treasurer press release).\n\n\n\n\nElection update:\nIt is expected that the Australian General election will be held sometime between April and May 2022. Independents may hold the balance of power.\n\r\nOmicron virus is creating issues once again with border closures. Infection rates continue to climb. Workers are seeking to continue to work from home at least for 3 days per week. This may become a further issue in 2022.\n\n\n\n\nJobs growth:\nIndustries tipped to continue growth in 2022 are, Healthcare sector, Logistics &Supply Chain, Cybersecurity, Technology and Biotechnology/ Pharmaceutical.\n\n\nChina\n\n\nKeeping growth stability is top priority in 2022:\nThe annual Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC) released one memo confirming that Beijing has undoubtedly shifted its policy focus to “growth stability” due to downward pressure on growth. Seeking growth stability is top priority in 2022.\n\n\n\n\nProperty market curbs policy could be maintained:\n The memo reiterated the catchphrase “housing is for living, not for speculation”, which suggests there will be no 180-degree shift in existing property curbs for now, and the hawkish stance of “resolutely preventing new additions of local government hidden debt”. The high expectation on easing the property market might be disappointed.\n\n\n\n\nGDP growth slowdown is projected\nThe growth slowdown may continue. It is projected that GDP growth will be at the annual increase of 5% by various analytical and market research channel. However, it is anticipated that more aggressive easing and stimulus measures may only be introduced in spring 2022.\n\n\n\n\nTriple pressure on Chinese Economy\nThe Chinese economy is facing three types of pressures on both the supply and demand sides: contracting demand, supply-side shocks, and weakened expectations.\n\n\n\n\nPolicy review on campaign against carbon emission and energy consumption:\nThe current memo highlighted that “coal as the major energy source is one fundamental reality of the country” and the government should “push for an optimized mix of coal and alternative energy”. The memo eased energy consumption controls by excluding the use of additional renewable energy from total energy consumption cap.\n\n\n\n\nZero-Covid strategy will extend to 2022:\nChina has been leading globally in containing Covid-19 and will continue to stop the coronavirus reaching China from abroad, Beijing will not abandon its zero-Covid strategy (ZCS) any time soon, in line with our view that Beijing will extend it well into 2022 or 2023 However, its gains are likely to diminish, while its pains could rapidly rise, exerting downward pressure on growth in 2022.\n\n\n\n\nNet injection of RMB750 billion to increase liquidity:\nThe People Bank of China released RMB1.2trn of liquidity by implementing the announced 50bp universal RRR cut. It also rolled over RMB500bn of the RMB950bn in maturing MLF, resulting in a net liquidity injection of RMB750bn.\n\n\n\n\nAction on foreign exchange to weaken Yuan:\nThe People’ Bank of China announced an 2pp RRR hike on FX deposits to 9% from 7%. It is a clear signal that it does not want to see a stronger yuan after a period of rapid appreciation against its basket. The action is also in line with the forecast on an incoming weaker export growth.\n\n\n\n\nCPI inflation will most likely be on an uptrend:\nDue to growth slowdown and the zero-Covid strategy, Nomura projects CPI inflation is most likely be on an uptrend and might be below 3.0%. CPI inflation risk is not low due to weak demand.\n\n\nSingapore\n\n\nSingapore economy grew 7.1% in Q3, full-year GDP growth narrowed to about 7%. Despite aviation and tourism related sectors seeing a slow recovery, semiconductors and financial services in insurance and fund management were some of the stronger performers in 2021.\n\n\n\r\nSingapore is expected to grow moderately by 3-5% for 2022. High vaccination rate and travel lane expansions with countries will help bolster air travel and ease labour shortages for various sectors reliant on foreign labour.\n\n\n\r\nCredit/Payment processing services, IT digital solutions, Financial Services and Semiconductors will continue to be growth sectors going into 2022.\n\n\nNew Zealand\n\n\nForecasts of household spending, residential construction and business investment have been revised lower for the year to March 2022:\n This reflects a degree of uncertainty about the new strain of COVID-19 plus the effects of the physical constraints from the New Zealand economy operating at Alert Level 4, and subsequently its largest city Auckland and some neighbouring regions at Alert Level 3 (with the social distancing restrictions of Alert Level 2 for the rest of the country also having an impact). Beyond March 2022, growth has been revised slightly higher, indicating that households and businesses are expected to stay resilient. While the latest lockdown in Auckland has dented consumer confidence, stronger wage growth resulting from acute labour shortages is supporting household spending.\n\n\n\n\nNonetheless, higher labour costs are sharpening businesses’ focus on investment in labour saving technology:\n Growing capacity pressures in the New Zealand economy are contributing to a sharp rise in inflation, followed by a fall. Despite this, beyond near-term expectations of annual CPI inflation rising above 5 percent in 2022, price rises are expected to remain elevated above the Reserve Bank’s inflation target mid-point of 2 percent through to 2025.\n\n\n\n\nNear-term growth outlook revised lower Forecasts for GDP have again been revised lower in the near term:\n This reflects supply constraints and the effects of the lockdown restrictions persisting in New Zealand for much longer than initially expected. Annual average growth in GDP for the year to March 2022 has been revised down to 4.3 percent. However, the upward revision to growth forecasts for the subsequent years suggests a continued positive growth outlook.\n\n\n\n\nExport outlook more positive:\n Forecasts for export growth have been revised higher over much of the projection, reflecting strong global demand. Although new variants of COVID -19 introduce additional uncertainty to the global growth outlook, demand for New Zealand exports is expected to remain strong over the coming years. Meanwhile, the import growth outlook remains solid despite the disruption.\n\n\n\n\nInflation outlook revised sharply higher:\n CPI inflation increased sharply in the September quarter, and forecasts are for inflation to settle back while remaining elevated through to 2025. Annual CPI inflation is forecast to surge to above 5 percent for the year to March 2022 before edging back within the Reserve Bank’s inflation target of 1 to 3 percent in the following year. Nonetheless, inflation is expected to remain above the inflation target mid-point over the coming years.\n\n\n\n\nLabour shortages underpin wage growth:\n Forecasts for annual wage growth have been revised higher through to 2024, as the labour market is expected to remain very tight over the coming years. The average forecast for the unemployment rate is for it to track 3.6 percent through to 2023 before lifting in the subsequent years.\n\r\nSource – New Zealand Institute of Economic Research\n\n\nEUROPE\n\n\nDenmark\n\n\nGDP in Denmark is expected to reach ca. 325 USD Billion by the end of 2021:\n It is a drop down from 356.08 billion US in 2020. The Danish economy advanced by 2.0 percent on quarter in the three months to September of 2021, slowing from a 2.8 percent expansion in the previous period. According to Trading Economics global macro models and analysts’ expectations the Denmark GDP is projected to trend around 340.00 USD Billion in 2022, so a slower but still solid rebound. In the long-term, the Denmark GDP Growth Rate is thereby projected to trend around 0.60 percent in 2022 and most likely a slower around 0.50 percent growth in 2023.\n\n\n\n\nThe unemployment rate in Denmark declined to 3.3 percent in September of 2021:\n It was a downwardly revised 3.5 percent in the previous month. It was the lowest jobless rate since December 2008, as the number of unemployed people decreased by 5,400 to 94,617. The unemployment rate for men fell to 3.2 percent in September from 3.4 percent in August, while for women dropped to 3.4 percent from 3.6 percent. Denmark is expected to be 3.90 percent by the end of this quarter, according to Trading Economics global macro models and analysts’ expectations. In the long-term, the Denmark Unemployment Rate is projected to trend around 4.10 percent in 2022 and 4.00 percent in 2023.\n\n\n\n\nDanish consumer confidence index dropped into negative territory for the first time in 7 months:\n It fell to -2.0 in November of 2021 from 3.3 in the previous month, amid rising\n\n\n\r\nCOVID-19 infections. It was the weakest reading since March, due to a deterioration in both households’ views on households' financial situation the next 12 months (5.7 vs 9.8 in October) and the general economic situation in the next 12 months (-3.2 vs 9.7). Denmark recorded 453802 Coronavirus Cases since the epidemic began, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In addition, Denmark reported 2816 Coronavirus Deaths.\n\r\nAll data delivered by and copyright to ©2021 TRADING ECONOMICS\n\n\nFrance\n\n\nThe economic recovery continues in France:\n However, the points of vigilance are becoming more salient, whether it be inflationary pressures or the return of health uncertainty. In the major economies of the euro zone, the recovery was clear during the summer. France has broadly returned to its pre-crisis level of activity (Q4 2019) by Q3 2021.\n\n\n\n\nThe forecast for France in the second quarter of 2022:\n Assuming that by then health restrictions would not tighten further, only marginally affecting the momentum of the recovery at the macro level, and that supply difficulties would persist in part, dissipating only slowly. In this context, the French economy would continue to rebound, at a rate of +0.5% in the fourth quarter of 2021, +0.4% in the first quarter of 2022 and +0.5% in the second.\n\n\n\n\nIn spring 2022, French GDP would then be 1.4% above its pre-crisis level:\n The mid-year growth rate (i.e., the annual growth rate that would be obtained for 2022 if economic activity were to remain frozen in the third and fourth quarters at the level forecast for the second quarter) would amount to +3.0%, after GDP growth of +6.7% on average per year in 2021.\n\r\nFrench growth would be driven mainly by market services, and to a lesser extent by industry. The rebound of certain services that were badly affected in 2020-2021 by the measures taken to contain the epidemic, such as international tourism, should nevertheless remain hesitant due to the health context. Household consumption should return to its pre-crisis level in the first half of 2022, while business investment should slow down after its very strong growth in 2021. Exports are expected to remain below their pre-crisis level, but to rise sharply in the fourth quarter of 2021 and then in the second quarter of 2022 on the back of large ship deliveries.\n\n\n\n\nAfter its very strong rebound, employment is expected to continue to grow:\n However, at a slower pace, in line with economic activity. Wage employment would thus increase by a little more than 150,000 in the second half of 2021, then by 80,000 in the first half of 2022. The working population is expected to stabilise over the forecast horizon, following its sharp rise this summer when the activity rate reached an unprecedented level. The unemployment rate falls to 7.8% of the labour force in the fourth quarter of 2021 and gradually declines to 7.6% in the first half of 2022.\n\n\n\n\nThe year-on-year increase in consumer prices reached 2.8% in November 2021:\n It is mainly driven by energy prices. Assuming that oil and commodity prices stabilise, inflation would remain above 2.5% in the first half of 2022, but its composition would change: the contribution of energy would decrease while that of manufactured goods would increase, reflecting with a delay the very sharp rise in industrial production prices (+14% over one year in October 2021).\n\n\n\r\nThus, the economic situation remains singular in many respects, and several hazards are likely to affect the forecast, both upwards and downwards.\n\n\n\r\nEven if economic activity is now more resilient to the resurgence of Covid-19, the fifth wave and the appearance of a new variant whose danger is not yet fully understood reinforce the uncertainty. Constraints on supplies appeared very early in the recovery: a possible normalisation of the health situation, particularly in Asia, could help to reduce them. In parallel, inflationary pressures raise the question of the timing of monetary policy tightening. Finally, consumption could eventually prove to be more dynamic than expected, if households draw on some of the savings accumulated during the confinements.\n\r\nSource: INSEE\n\n\nGermany\n\n\nThe current general business atmosphere in Germany looks uncertain:\n This is because the forecasts are declining again. Business spirit in a few sectors is ongoing positive but even those are facing shortages of qualified employees or of pre-products or basic materials. Influence from pandemic shall continue in Q1 of 2022 with restructuring effort or lockdowns and small government recovery spending and job retention schemes. Some details at German Central Bank web page show small differences only in numbers for sector by sector compared to other countries in Europe and North America.\n\n\n\n\nThe GDP forecast numbers for 2021 and the outlook for 2022 are declining :\n The data from German Central Bank is 5.2% for 2022 down to 4.2% increase as of 13th of December 2021. Decreases in forecast may continue resulting in not reaching the 2019 numbers again in 2022 but later - accompanied by cancellation for lots of business events in the first quarter of 2022.\n\n\n\r\nUnemployment rate in Germany is still low but not a meaningful data due to job retention schemes and some so-called career qualification programs.\n\n\n\n\nInflation is growing:\n The European Central Bank ECB is targeting slow against it and will do so for the whole of 2022, not following the decisions from US and UK Central banks. This could be good for governments in some countries but unsettle citizens and not help consumers and the economy at all.\n\n\n\r\nThe federal elections in September 2021 resulted in a red-green-yellow coalition. Current announcements sound future oriented. In detail it looks like red for socialistic spending, green for directives and controls oriented and liberal or free for business or innovation friendly and the result may be positive for employees and scary on the capital or saving side. How long the coalition is enduring time will tell indeed.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a lack of monies in federal government due to the pandemic:\n Europe wide recovery programs implemented mid 2020 with 750 bn Euro targets for most southern European countries sound beneficial. For Germany after benefits it means a net spending of 25-30 % of the large sum. Later in 2021, pandemic effects in Germany were stronger and monies are missing for some investment, innovation and recovery activities in the country. As a result, federal government is looking for household tricks.\n\n\n\r\nFor employees the country remains attractive due to social system, wages, living quality and security. Some sectors are best in class worldwide in innovation and production ranging from mRNA vaccine development to environmentally friendly production technologies. Foreign investors still aim for Germany, arguments range from safe haven for money to the economic, social and political stability.\n\n\nRussia\n\n\nThe inflation in Russia in 2021 grew faster than in many other countries.\n By the end of 2021, The Central Bank of Russia expects inflation to be between 7.4 - 7.9%. The intention now is to pursue a monetary policy that will lead inflation to the goal of being closer to 4%. The Central Bank of Russia has been consistently raising its key rate since spring from 4.25% to the current 7.5%.\n\n\n\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Economy expects an increase of GDP at the level of 4.2% for 2021:\n GDP growth in 2022 is expected to be at 3.0%. In a briefing with AEB, the head of the Central Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina, estimated the growth rate to be 4-4.5% this year. According to The World Bank the economic growth of Russia in 2022 will be only 2.4 %.\n\n\n\n\nEmployment/Unemployment forecasts for 2022:\n After a peak in the unemployment at 6.4% in August 2020 the unemployment dropped to only 4.3% in September 2021 in Russia according to Statista. The slow restoration of economic growth will promote a positive development of the labour market. With the help of a state program, national projects and regional projects, the following measures are to be realized in the future: training of unemployed citizens and the increase of efficiency in employment services; creation and\n\r\nsupport of information systems and digital services; support for entrepreneurial activities and self-employment of citizens; and last but not least the digitalization of labour relations to develop more flexible or remote forms of employment.\n\n\n\n\nFor 2022 Trading Economics forecasts 4.1% unemployment and as low as 3.8% in 2023. \n\n\n\n\nOil Export and Forecast 2022:\n As the dynamics of physical volumes of oil exports stabilize and oil prices decrease, oil exports will shift to moderate growth and support the overall economic growth. We are now approaching the level of consumption that we had before the pandemic started. It is said to be quite possible that the pre-pandemic level will even be exceeded according to Stanislav Mitrakhovich, leading expert of the National Energy Security Fund and the Financial University. Similarly, Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Sorokin estimates that, as soon as the OPEC+ deal and the market’s needs allow, Russia will be able to speed up its oil output to pre-pandemic levels. According to Bloomberg calculations, Russia’s forecasted output for next year will be equivalent to an average of 11.24 million barrels per day. Russia produced 11.25 million barrels a day in 2019, the highest level in its post-Soviet history.\n\n\n\n\nMajor Events affecting 2022 Outlook:\n In 2022 there will be a simplified tax system. Changes will be made in order to simplify payments. For example, lawmakers will study the possibility of introducing a single tax for businesses, which will be very convenient for the self-employed individuals.\n\n\nSpain\n\n\nGDP is forecast to grow by 5.5% in 2022\n and 3.8% in 2023, supported by tax and monetary policies.\n\n\n\r\nDomestic demand will be the main driver of growth due to: (i) rising confidence, (ii) an improving labour market, (iii) favourable financing conditions and (iv) public funds from the European Recovery Plan, in order to boost private consumption and investment.\n\n\n\n\nHeadline Inflation in 2022 will remain high\n, due to the carryover effect from 2021, while core inflation will remain at a moderate level. Tax policies are expected to remain favourable in 2022 and broadly neutral in 2023.\n\n\n\r\n1. The unemployment rate will reach 14.6% in Q4 2021.\n\r\n2. Public debt will also stand at very high levels, close to 117% of GDP.\n\r\n3. The inflation rate forecast for 2021 is 5.2%.\n\n\n\n\n2022 areas of interest:\n A new law on tax exemptions is approved for both start-ups and entrepreneurs who are able to locate their companies in the Spanish territory. Real Estate will also continue to rise.\n\n\nUK\n\n\nHousehold spending would remain the key driver of the economy:\n The Confederation of British Industry, the UK’s leading business lobby group, said in June 2021 that it expected the economy to expand by 8.2% in 2022. But in December 2021 it cut that prediction to 6.9% and revised down its 2022 forecast from 6.9% to 5.1%.\n\n\n\r\nThe accounting firm KPMG issued an even gloomier prediction, saying it expects growth to reach 4.2% next year at best, even if the Omicron variant turns out to be a “false alarm”. Household spending would remain the key driver of the economy, the employers’ organisation said, generating 90% of growth in 2022, and two-thirds of gross domestic product in 2023.\n\n\n\n\nConsumer spending would be supported by households:\n They would be running down excess savings accumulated during the pandemic. It predicted unemployment would rise only slightly as a result of the winding-up of the government’s furlough scheme and the jobless rate would return to its pre-crisis level of 3.8% by the end of 2023.\n\n\n\n\nThe U.K. is headed for the fastest growth in the G-7 this year and next:\n The findings highlight risks from the pandemic and Britain’s departure from the European Union, which have added friction at the border that’s disrupting the flow of goods and workers. The forecasts show that by 2023, the year before the deadline for the next election, growth is likely to moderate sharply while inflation remains above the Bank of England’s 2% target.\n\n\n\r\n“Labour shortages are emerging in sectors particularly affected by the pandemic and in which EU-born migrants were also over-represented, such as accommodation and food services,” the OECD said in its report.\n\n\n\n\nUK SME business owners voiced their concern about the impact Brexit is having on their trading:\n 56% of business owners are finding it more difficult to buy and/or sell with the EU compared to 32% who have not seen their trading impacted. 2022 should see an easing of these issues as clarity and awareness of requirements become the norm.\n\n\n\n\nRapid house prices growth seen during the past year is expected to moderate:\n This is largely due to the rising cost of mortgages and the end of the temporary cut to stamp duty. Some locations may continue to benefit from buyers who can take advantage of a reduced need for commuting to move away from traditional market hotspots in favour of more affordable alternatives further afield.\n\n\nTHE AMERICAS\n\n\nBRAZIL\n\n\n2021 Brazilian Economy -\n The Brazilian economy in 2021 was severely impacted by the Covid 19 pandemic. The valuation of the dollar and most recently by the oil hike, among other internal factors and the historical chaos of the 3-year recession has given cause to the inflation burst, followed by the institution of its antidote, the abrupt hike in the interest rates.\n\n\n\n\n2022 and 2023 Brazilian GDP / Other Economic KPI’s Outlook\n Central Bank of Brazil just divulged their Focus Survey Report of 12/27, containing the representative Economic & Financial Market Agents’ forecast for the 2022 and 2023 Economic KPI’s, as follows:\n\n\n\r\na) GDP estimates for 2021 closed at 4.51%; 2022 and 2023 GDP forecasts quoted at 0.42% and 1.80, respectively\n\n\n\r\nb)Inflation Rate estimate for 2021 reached 10.02%, vs. official target of 3.75%, 2022 and 2023 forecasts are reported to be 5.03% (target: 3.5%) and 3.38% respectively\n\n\n\r\nc) Official Annual Interest Rate (Selic), currently at 9.25%, is forecasted at 11.50% for 2022 and 8.00% for 2023\n\n\n\r\nd) Total Direct Investments in 2021 were US$ 52 billion; forecasts for 2022 points at US$ 58 billion and US$ 70 billion for 2023.\n\n\n\n\nImprovement in the Unemployment Rate – \nThere has been a noticeable recovery in\n\r\nthe Brazilian general labor market, since the last quarter of 2021. Despite of the historical high unemployment figure, back from the last years of the Brazilian economic recession, there has been a confirmed improvement in the general/overall labor market situation, in most of the economic sectors. According to IPEA – Institute of Applied Economic Research, of IBGE, in their 12/21 Report, the general unemployment rate dropped from about 13.5% down to 12.5%, the lowest level since April 2020. The number of “desalentados”/hopeless, discouraged workers (those who constantly looked for jobs for over 2 years and have given up doing it) fell from 58 million down to 5.1 million.\n\n\n\n\n“Programa Auxílio Brasil” –\n Effective immediately, a meaningful social program, in terms of continuous financial help and increased benefit to the “very poor” has been launched by the government, replacing a traditional program of lower financial benefit. The program calls for a monthly pay of R$ 400,00 (around US$ 72.00) to about 17 million families, at a cost of R$ 89 billion (US$ 16 billion).\n\n\n\n\nEVE AIR MOBILITY - Brazilian Flying Car Program – \n Embraer, the Brazilian transnational manufacturer and exporter of 130 seat commercial jets, executive and military jets, and agricultural aircrafts, has announced the initial production of 300 flying cars. As a subsidiary of Embraer, Eve holds a partnering investment with US Zanite of US$ 2.4-US$ 2.9 billion and will be listed in the NYSE, under Embraer -\n\n\nUSA\n\n\nBusiness and Economic Overview – A truly mixed bag:\n\n\n\r\n• The US economy is still growing as various reports indicate that households/consumers continue spending despite an ongoing increase of COVID-19 cases including the known and identified delta and omicron variants.\n\n\n\r\n• Credit card spending and increasing balances with higher minimum payments may slow spending if the recovery faulters. Inflation is being felt most heavily by buyers of big-ticket items such as cars, homes and other major capital expenditures.\n\n\n\r\n• Almost every report suggests that higher inflation is weighing on purchasing power but many consumers who have not purchased major capital items such as new homes and automobiles seem to be disregarding what appears to be the highest increase in consumer inflation for almost 40 years.\n\n\n\r\n• Supply chain bottlenecks continue despite governmental intervention to reduce impediments to off-loading imports. Media reports point to an apparent easing of shortages in most supply chain categories.\n\n\n\r\n• Downside risks are highly varied and very recent reports suggest an easing. Retailers including the famed $dollar stores are raising prices which will likely burden lower income consumers.\n\n\n\r\n• Commodity prices increases may be edging down at the producer level but have shown minimal impact on end-user (consumer) prices we track.\n\n\n\r\n• Financial pundits are claiming that inflation expectations are edging down from what are the highest levels in almost 40 years and remain well above the pre virus crisis levels.\n\n\n\r\n• The uncertainty of rising interest rates which are continually being altered by the Federal Reserve appear to be causing a discomfort amongst investors, lenders and borrowers.\n\n\n\r\n• The apparent % of economic growth when adjusted for inflation still seems to be a healthy 3-4%.\n\n\n\n\nThe Jobs Market and Wages are even more inconsistent:\n\n\n\r\n• The jobs market appears to be steadying with the shortfall of available workers at the lower wage levels and the “great quitting” poorly explained at the moment. We note that it appears that the largest international executive search firms are now offer their services at far lower levels using various search engines to identify and perhaps even qualify potential candidate prospects.\n\n\n\r\n• While multiple sources appear to be a bit inconsistent in explaining the reasons for the above – it appears that there is a plethora of reasons for individuals making decisions to leave their employment. Personal issues including vaccine mandates, high costs for child and elder care as well as increased transportation expenses are often sited but data appears inconsistent. The availability of jobless benefits (wage replacement) is waning and may contribute to more active job seeking than previously. Employer preferences are also a part of an ongoing evolution including work from home or work from a specified location.\n\n\n\r\n• As well, employers appear to be very inconsistent in hiring “contract employees” vs. full-time in areas for which demand may be unsettled. Contract employees typically receive more cash than their employee peers but are not likely to receive benefit plans which makes contractors more attractive in many cases. It is uncertain how well the quantitative analysis by various entities is reporting these results.\n\n\n\n\nThe Jobs Market and Wages show more inconsistency in forecasts:\n Wages in the form of direct compensation – salaried and hourly will likely rise particularly for low wage/low skill employees as many cannot justify the cost of working. Wages for professionals and technical employees including professionals and senior management are also likely to rise as long service employees are seemingly retiring. Airlines have released date which demonstrate the number of retirement eligible senior pilots who used to avoid retirement before mandatory age requirements – are now retiring earlier.\n\n\n\r\nQuestions continue to arise around various service jobs ranging from medical professionals to drivers. How bad will the shortage be in the near future as more attractive jobs continue to emerge or re-emerge. Governmental and private research is a bit inconsistent in their reporting and while some of the differences may be as a result of capturing slightly different timelines and various locations, it is clear that the labour market broadly defined, and employee compensation practices will be unsettled until other issues are resolved.\n\n\n\r\nUnresolved Issues contributing to the variables we observe include but are not limited to matters largely beyond the control of individual employers, businesses, or employees. The somewhat more destabilized global issues – political, military, the Covid-19 pandemic and trade related all have an impact. Some specifics include:\n\n\n\r\n1. The ongoing conflict and disturbance caused by the former president and his supporters\n\n\n\r\n2. Division instead of consensus in our governmental action which is increasing societal, racial and economic conflicts. Consensus building is no longer readily possible, so reforms, economic recovery and life are generally harder.\n\n\n\r\n3. Environmental issues and environmental remediation which require governmental consensus and support are being slowed.\n\n\n\r\n4. Governmental and judicial inquiries into the conduct of political entities, citizens and business are disturbing progress.\n\n\n\r\n5. Securities markets are increasingly volatile in the face of governmental inconsistency and lack of leadership.\n\n\n\r\nUS businesses and Global businesses doing business in the US are for the moment not particularly unsettled but as political figures disparage the business interests of our trading partners, concerns mount amongst investors, employers, economists, and government.\n\n\n\n\nAs we have analysed the varied predictions for growth and inflation\n, it is impossible to overlook the possibility of economic unsettlement as the western world contends with internal conflicts. As well, it is a contentious period amongst stake holders in Eastern Europe, particularly the relationships between the Russian and the Ukraine as well as the material refugee crisis emanating from the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Continued issues with China and the impact of Covid-19, which are quite unsettled, make forecasts for 2022 very tenuous.\n\n\n\r\nIf current consumer and employer demand continue without major undesirable global events, it would appear that a continuation of pre-Covid employment growth (3-4%) and modest acceleration of GDP as adjusted for inflation should continue. We are all ware of the possibilities of unexpected events undoing the realization of growth.\n\n\n\r\nWe have not carved out Canada as the size of Canada and their exceptional growth in 2021 suggest continuation of modest employment growth with stability and acceleration. Natural resource products as well as financial growth are expected but probably not at the same levels as were sustained in 2021.\n\n\n\r\nWe close with the thought that unsettlement in the social, political and governmental issues are contributing to an air of uncertainty in the economy at large as well as in the employment markets. We need to be watchful and adjust as needed.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (5526)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Being termed as the ‘Great Resignation Wave’, the phenomenon is a nightmare come true for both large and small organizations. So, what exactly is driving this exodus from the workplace?\nAccording to experts, the last two years have been quite challenging for people, and this has led to a major shift in the mindset. As the world is slowly opening up, people are leaving their jobs in search of more money, more flexibility, and more happiness. Many are rethinking what work means to them, how they are valued at work, and how they spend their time. It's leading to a dramatic increase in resignations — According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 4 million Americans quit their jobs in July 2021.\nWorking from home also changed people’s attitude towards their work. Flexibility that people enjoyed while working from home is a big ask as people return to work and, in its absence, they would rather quit and look for a job that offers flexibility in order to enjoy what they discovered for themselves while working from home.\nThe new mantra where the work is no longer just about paying bills but also living life to the fullest is taking over. The fact that earlier people were ready to commute for a couple of hours every day to their jobs no longer holds true. On the other hand, organizations are struggling to acquire talent. During this trying period, the most important thing for organizations is to retain talent and make any required changes to rewards, flexibility, and compensation.\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (5411)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Zoom meetings and Microsoft teams have replaced conference rooms and town hall discussions. This new normal is here to stay and remote working or hybrid model of work is going to be the norm. But diminishing human interaction and meeting co-workers only over Zoom is creating ‘Zoom fatigue’. Video calls and meets are turning into an exhausting experience. Employees across the world are looking towards a less exhausting and more immersive experience and Metaverse seems to be the best answer.\nSo far this idea of Metaverse was primarily focused on the entertainment and gaming industry. But the future of meetings seems to be in the hands of Metaverse. Bill Gates has claimed that in the next 3 years most meetings and conferences will happen on Metaverse. Whether it’s a mere thought of going to be a reality, we can expect a few things from future meetings on Metaverse.\nIncreased productivity\nThe direct consequence of an immersive experience is increased productivity. The meetings would seem ‘live’ and close to the in-person experience with greater mobility. Even \n human capital search services\n will seek people who are well-versed with the Metaverse. This is evident from the fact that the number of jobs with ‘Metaverse’ as a keyword has increased from one to 217 over a year.\nEnhanced team collaboration\nEmpathy lies at the core of team bonding, morale, team cohesion, and communication. Without physical meetings, empathy seems to be dropping and so is team bonding. But with Metaverse, employees can come together at the same place, without social distancing, and experience the human connection, can build rapport, and nurture empathy.\nNot that costly\nOne concern with enterprises was the cost of setting up this digital infrastructure. With more and more organizations into the ecosystem, prices of AR VR devices have started reducing. It is not far when \n human resource consulting firms\n would use Metaverse for recruitments and interviews. It will no longer be a sellers’ market but soon become a buyers’ market.\nTrue immersive experience\nYou might have doubt as to how can the entire in-person experience be replicated? All your senses, sound, sight, smell, and touch would be engaged to create a world where you have a truly memorable experience. Some experts say that this experience might be better than the in-person conference room experience. Distance will no longer be a factor and two people situated miles apart can meet in a café and conduct business meetings with ease.\nUnlimited networking opportunities\nYou have often heard \n human capital consulting services\n boost their networks. With Metaverse it's just going to increase many times over. Metaverse presents unlimited networking opportunities. Your network won’t be limited to a conference room or cubicles around you. You can connect with each person in the virtual ecosystem. The venue won't be a constraint, and every event can host an unlimited number of audiences.\nThese are just a few perks of meetings over Metaverse. Whether it's coming in three years or in a decade’s time is debatable, but Metaverse is going to be the future of meetings!\nAt The Taplow Group we not only help you source the best fit for your organization’s leadership through our \n executive search consultants\n but also train and develop them to hone their skills.

To ensure these deliveries are at lightning-fast speed, retailers need to have a huge fleet of delivery personnel, logistics, vehicles, and other equipment in place.\nWarehouses, not stores\nThe need for additional hands is not required in the warehouses and delivery centers, rather than in the stores. As most shopping is done online, retailers are employing more people at their fulfillment and distribution centers.\nSelf-checkout\nVisit the latest apple or amazon stores and experience self-checkouts or roving checkouts. These techs have replaced the need for over-the-counter personnel but have opened positions for techies across the globe.\nSecurity\nWith everything going online, retailers are now looking to invest in data security and the protection of \n consumer\n information.\nTechnology is indeed the driving factor shaping retail hiring and in store shopping is likely to take a back seat for a while.\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (4986)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

AI is revolutionizing candidate search and is contributing significantly towards bettering search outcomes. Traditional Executive Search process lacks accelerators, and this is where AI saves the day by using big data to narrow down the search process, mapping the right profile and accordingly finding the best possible candidate.\nAI in recruitment can be useful every step of the way, be it to scan resumes or vetting potential candidates. AI also increases the chances of finding the right candidate and ensures prior candidates are re-engaged in roles they can truly grow in. AI Executive search also has an added advantage over traditional methods wherein it tends to find passive candidates that would’ve been ignored otherwise.\nEven though recruiters now have access to a lot more data, AI has helped make the search process more niche. The best and most useful feature of AI perhaps is its ability to reach the right candidate in the least amount of time. Online activity and digital communication play a key role in helping achieve this. AI studies digital footprints and ensures we reach relevant and interested candidates that possess the desirable skillset. \nExperts are claiming that AI has created a major disruption as it has majorly reduced manual labor and more importantly removed the human bias involved in the process. It has also contributed towards data being far more accessible, relevant, and streamlined. However, Artificial Intelligence is highly unlikely to ever replace certain interactions that are possible only with a human touch, like the rapport search executives build with candidates, the ability to see a candidate’s potential beyond what is mentioned on the resume, judging cultural fit and interpersonal skills and above all convincing a candidate to accept the role.\nSo, the best option is to combine both and put their advantages to the best use possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2706)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

There is a strong need for organizational leaders to pay close attention to the local and global environment in order to meet their “sustainable development goals”. Organizational culture stems from the responsible behavior of \n leaders.\n A sustainable culture is never built by HR, EHS or EMS teams but is the accountability of those on top of the hierarchy.\nThe concept of responsibility is subjective. Responsible leadership can often be a vague and confusing concept which is why it is essential to use the right \n executive search consultant\n to find you leaders who don’t just add to your corporate social responsibility but also direct it. Efficient executive search management consulting removes the ambiguity around the desirable responsible leadership and helps you find strong leaders who have their own personal notion of the same.\nResponsible leadership and sustainability in an organization is driven by the core values and belief systems of its leaders. Employees tend to look up to the leaders to determine the behavioral norms of the organization. This influence is a very large responsibility, making it all the more essential to find you the right fit for the role.\nEvery leader has their individual traits that distinguishes them and makes the organization stand out from its competitors but there is a general overview of skills that are valued by the employees and stakeholders alike. These include a strong sense of sustainable judgment, long-term thinking and strategic mindset, problem solving, moral courage and effective communication skills. All leaders of the organization collectively determine the culture, ethics and behaviors that shape the organization. Business success and an organization’s DNA is ultimately driven by the leaders, which is a fact that a smart \n executive recruitment consultant\n fully comprehends. The sign of a successful and responsible leader is his/her ability to drive their team towards results instead of dwelling on conflicts or obstacles.\nA team where everyone is equally driven and empowered as well as accountable to the organization’s goals and culture is a team that thrives in the longer run. Accountability of each individual collectively makes sustainability a shared responsibility. Of course, this comes with its own set of risks such as Groupthink.\nGroupthink is an extreme situation where the well-being of the organization is overlooked by the desire to maintain harmony and have a smooth decision-making process. A situation like Groupthink is a warning to most leaders that an overwhelming need for cohesiveness often results in poor strategic decisions that are bound to hamper the success of the organization. Even though \n leadership\n is a collective effort, having your own voice and using it to express your point of view in a respectful yet effective manner is equally important.\nOrganizational culture is a direct reflection of the core values and beliefs of the leaders that shape the entity. It also gives insight into the corporate mindset that has developed over the years. So, it’s important to remember that your leaders need to act for the collective gain of the organization instead of their individual gains and you need to share your expectation with your while choosing your\n executive search services\n partner. Responsible leadership also plays a key role in ensuring that the employees know their work is valued and they’re cherished.\nEmbracing responsible leadership enhances an organization’s sense of purpose, drives success, and boosts collective strength which will be available for all the stakeholders to witness and appreciate. It’s also an attractive element which helps in reeling new talent and potential customers. Responsible leadership holds immense value in long term and can sustain difficult economic times efficiently. It requires a different mindset and is an added effort, but the results have time and again proven that it’s worth it.

A positive employer brand attracts the best talent and, in a candidate-driven market it can be a decisive factor to become the employer of choice. Employer branding is both, your reputation among the job seekers and your current workforce. For example, your marketing team is doing a fantastic job of selling your product or service, but your HR team is struggling to acquire or retain talent, you should take it as a sign to looking into your employer brand.\nIn today’s digital world where job seekers, almost 75%, according to a LI survey, look at a brand’s social media profiles to gauge the reputation of an organization and 69% would not apply if they don’t like what they see. Therefore, projecting the right image is extremely critical.\nOrganizations should approach employer branding as a means of creating a business identity. You must find a creative and engaging way to present your brand to the world. Actively showcasing all the things that make your organization special like employee stories, customer testimonials, highlighting your learning and development initiatives or anything that demonstrates that what a fun and relaxed environment your organization has can go a long way in creating an employer brand.\nAn active presence on social media will enable your organization to stay on top of mind for both, active and passive talent. Remember, positive employer branding will help you to attract and retain quality employees, who are crucial to the success and growth of your organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3014)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

It requires the identification of key positions and accordingly their replacements well in advance so that the business or enterprise does not go into chaos when the present leadership steps down. Succession planning is imperative for any kind of business, be it a big enterprise or a small start-up, or a family-owned business.\nIn the absence of a full-proof succession plan, a business may lose reputation, client-base, investor support, and stakeholder sentiments. The absence of a leader brings in instability and disruption, throwing everyone out of gear. When you have a plan in place, the transition becomes smooth, business operations aren’t hampered, and the flow of wealth continues. Secondly, it helps to retain investors' and stakeholders’ confidence and trust in the business. In difficult times, without proper leadership, investors might lose confidence and an entire business might just crumble and die. At the same time, think about the goodwill or the reputation in the market; they remain intact when your business operations continue like old times.\nNow, the process should not initiate when a leader or a top executive becomes incapable. It should start well in advance. Figure out the potential candidates and talk with the respective stakeholders, board of directors, and other senior leaders. Ensure that there is a smooth transition, and the new leader easily aligns with the organization’s culture, values, and vision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2988)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Diversity in the workforce begins with the diversity of the leadership team. If you want a truly diverse and inclusive workforce then you need to be very careful about who you select for top leadership positions. Let us discuss why you need diverse leadership and how we can build it for you with our \n executive search services.\nBut before we step into the top three reasons, let me tell you that it is not about ticking the checkboxes. Diversity does not mean you allocate quotas based on gender, ethnicity, religion, or physical abilities. It does not mean you strike off people just for the sake of diversity. If that’s your definition of diversity that let's erase that and begin fresh. Diversity starts with having an open mind. Every \n executive search consultant\n keeps in mind that diversity is about bringing a new perspective, fresh ideas, and relating to a wide range of the workforce.\nDiversity will boost performance\nWhen you have a diverse leadership team, you will find leaders bringing in unique ideas during problem-solving. The table will have different ideas coming from a wide range of experiences. At the same time, it will retain employees and help you attract better talent for your organization. In this employee-driven talent war, candidates are looking up to organizations and the diversity in their leadership. Finally, a diverse team will bring in diverse connections and we need not reiterate that your net worth is your network.\nDiversity will boost morale\nImagine how a female employee will feel if she is the lone female member of the team? Will someone from the minority group have anyone to look up to as a role model?\n Executive search management consulting\n is all about telling how to make your employees connect not only with the organization but also with the leadership. Diverse leadership will give them a role model, someone they will aspire to be, and feel that they are valued. This will give them the vision that there are indeed opportunities for them to progress in the company. When an employee sees someone, you can relate to in a position of power and authority, it works wonders on their morale and thereby performance.\nDiversity will benefit the society\nThe first gay CEO, a female CEO after 20 years – we have read these headlines, isn’t it? But think once, do we want these headlines. If we have diversity running from the top leadership, all through to the bottom then these demarcations would become irrelevant. No one would be surprised if someone from the minority community becomes the CEO, because these combinations would not be rare.\nWe come with our team of \n executive recruitment consultants\n to give you people insight so that you can hire the best leadership team, tailored for your organization. Yes, customization is the key, our executive search consultants will tailor every solution based on your industry, organization size, values, culture, and vision.

Missing out on selecting the best CEO or having the wrong person heading the organization. The results can be catastrophic and difficult to recover. Look around the world, why do you see some boards struggle to find their leader while others excel? The board with its skills and mentoring is not enough, you need specialized \n CEO search services\n to unlock the secrets of CEO selection.\nThe secret sauce to great CEO selection is simple. It is built on four fundamental spices starting with a clear view of the essential skills required in the new CEO. The second spice is having an open mind; at times you would not find the best match from your so-called pool of candidates and having an open mind about where the CEO is coming from definitely helps. You need to go deeper and deeper to determine the fit for the next CEO. A superficial analysis will never do the job and finally have room for accepting imperfections. Every CEO has some open flanks, but they can be stitched together with \n certified CEO training programs.\nFind the pivot\nStart with a clear understanding of the needs of the company, the present business landscape, competition, and other external factors. This would help you to narrow down to the essential capabilities that are intertwined together and are necessary for the new leader to succeed. Every situation, every industry is different – the pivot for the retail industry can be consumer experience, for automotive it can be knowledge about OEMs and smart manufacturing, while for the entertainment sector it can be the command over digital assets.\nHave an open mind\nThe experts at our \n CEO search services\n always keep an open mind. Your viewpoint and parameters can change from one situation to another and hence your initial list can never become the de-facto reference point. Be open to new candidates, candidates with different skills and experience that might become tremendously relevant in the coming future. You must strive for objectivity and not fixate on the front-runners only.\nGo deep on finding the right match\nWhen you are down to the last 2-3 candidates, it is not about the best candidate, it is about the best fit. Great \nCEO recruiters\n have their pivots clearly defined allowing them to go deep into the interview/conversation with the candidate. Post-interview they brainstorm and debate and question the rationale of the other. Have multiple interviews if needed but make sure that all the roads are leading to Rome, towards the best fit, the right match for your CEO position.\nBe patient with imperfections\nEvery CEO has some open ends, you cannot expect anyone to be 100% perfect. But with the right set of certified CEO training programs, one can close the gaps. But you need to be open and allow imperfections to come in, at the same time device ways to allow the person to close them quickly. Finding a great CEO is a difficult job, but if you have the best CEO search services with you, then there is little to worry about.\nAt The Taplow Group we help you source the best-fit for your organization’s leadership through our \n executive search consultants.\n To know more about our services like leadership coaching, professional hiring, management consulting, reach out to us at \n www.taplowgroup.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (4297)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

According to a recent survey, 78% of candidates said that the overall candidate experience they receive is a great indicator of how an organization values its workforce. The same survey also pointed out that that 86% of candidates believe that prospective employers should treat candidates with the same respect as current employees. The survey findings clearly indicate that the lines between candidate experience and employee experience are blurring. Therefore, organizations must work towards strengthening their candidate experience.\nThe first step is improving the application process. If your organization’s application process is lengthy, you run the risk of application abandonment. A short and streamlines job application will ensure that candidates complete the application process and thereby increase your organization’s applicant pool. To win the war for talent organizations must fine tune their candidate experience in order to attract the best of the best. How you communicate with a prospective candidate also determines how the candidate perceives your brand. Organizations must establish timely and clear communication with candidates to develop a positive candidate experience both about selection and rejection.\nTechnology can also go a long way in enhancing candidate experience. By creating mobile friendly career websites and other resources candidates may need while applying for job openings, organizations can ensure that they optimize their candidate experience. Today’s candidate driven market means that organizations are in competition to attract top talent and in order to be successful they must take control of their candidate experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3526)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

There is a constant need to innovate, look for faster-better-smarter ways to deliver game-changing talent and optimize the corporate workforce and senior executive careers. Organizations opt for \n executive search firms\n to look for niche, hard-to-find hires, especially in today’s candidate-driven market where superior talent is a huge competitive advantage.\nAt The Taplow Group, we understand the criticality of leadership hiring process and use the best possible ways for our search and find the most suitable candidates for the mandates on hand. Organizations are upbeat about the possibilities provided by technology, anxious about the economy, and (still) struggling with the talent shortage. So, what does 2022 look like for \n Global Executive Search professionals?\nHere is what the future holds for Global Executive Search:\n2022 is going to be the year of the candidate yet again. This means there is going to be more competition amongst the organizations to find and hire the best talent. This competition is the driving force behind the willingness of workers to leave their current positions for new jobs with better salary, bigger benefit packages, more opportunity for advancement, and much more.\nBoth, flexible schedules, and workplaces are here to stay. The last couple of years have been a testimony to the fact that flexibility and being able to work from home are both possible and effective. This enables \n global executive search firms\n to look for candidates beyond their geographical borders. Increased digitization has enabled global hiring and this trend will continue well into 2022 and beyond.\nHigh demand for diverse talent has never been greater. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion will continue to be on the board room agenda and organizations will actively look to improve equality in their hiring practices. Leaders will stay committed to equity and inclusion in the workplace. And \n Global Executive Search Firms\n will need scalable ways to ensure that they are able to deliver the desired diverse talent in a more efficient and timely manner.\nSocial recruiting is one of the most popular hiring trends that will continue to dominate in 2022 as well. With more and more people signing up and being hired on various platforms, it is no longer an option to be on social media for both, candidates as well as Global Executive Search Firms.

The pillars of corporate governance rest on the principles of purpose, people, process, and performance. This means that corporate governance includes aspects of legislative and legal compliance along with strategy formulation and policy-making for an organization. In short corporate governance goes well beyond just compliance and there is no risk greater than having poor corporate governance.\nAre you planning on improving your company’s performance and reputation? If yes, then the best channel is by partnering with a board governance services firm to ensure that your corporate governance is top notch. This will enable your organization to stay on top of its competition.\nHere are a few ways to improve your corporate governance include –\nDiversity your board\nDiversity is a serious issue.

Our \n board member recruitment consultants\n will help you identify the gaps and lags in your board composition and then fill them with the right candidate. Our consultants not only have in-depth industry knowledge but a wide pool of personal connections as well.\nMonitor performance\nWith the right set of people on board, your board is now all set to monitor the performance of the organization. The directors need to ensure that the corporate decisions are in line with the vision and mission of the organization. The performance of the organization should be closely monitored from multiple angles, profit just being one of them. The board members must also observe market sentiments, reputation, customer feedback and incorporate all these aspects in their governance policies\nInformation management\nBoard members need proper information to make the right decisions. But that does not mean that the senior management bombards them with information. There has to be an agreed format in which information is presented to the board and then every board member review, analyze, and draw insights from this information. This makes the interaction between senior management and the board members very critical.\nRisk management\nRisk is not limited to only compliance activities. Our \n board governance services firm \nwill guide you on all aspects of risk management including financial, legal, natural calamities, cyber security, and reputational risks. The board members must identify risks and communicate the same to the CEO and management so that effective risk mitigation measures can be adopted in time.\nSelf-evaluation\nThe board keeps a close eye on the senior management and important stakeholders but from time to time the board should evaluate its performance. This is where \n board member recruitment consultants\n bring in their expertise.

However, job adverts, or recruitment briefs, developed by organizations, can quickly lose the interest of potential candidates, who are often currently in rewarding roles, by talking too much about the company and not focusing on how a candidate can develop their skills further by taking up the said role. This is sure shot way to lose a candidate’s interest, which is easily done in todays “click / swipe” browser world.\n\n\n\r\nIn a time where the employment pendulum has swung in favour of potential candidates, people are seeking opportunities that will enable their growth and core skills development. But employers often ignore this, and to their detriment, focus on how wonderful they are, rather than what the prospective new hire can expect from the firm – other than potentially, more money and a better job title.\n\n\n\r\nThoughtful companies will include how the role will develop the prospective candidate, what the professional challenges and accomplishments might be and, what a candidates’ opportunities for further success in the organization might be.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nInterviews – a two-way process\n\n\n\r\nIn discussing interview protocols, we are critically aware of the importance of the right people interviewing/ meeting candidates. Businesses often require candidates to undertake multiple rounds of interviews, if made clear from the outset, this may not be an issue.\n\n\n\r\nIf all the interviews with multiple decision makers are “tell us about yourself” and “let’s review your CV”, candidates will quickly lose interest and withdraw from the process. Companies should be focused on the candidate, on why your firm is the best opportunity for the prospective new hire.\n\n\n\r\nThe slate of interviewers should be focused on key elements of the candidate, such as personal/ business expertise/ key dynamics of the role and candidate aspirations, then the process is holistic and motivational to the candidate to remain engaged.\n\n\n\r\nYour scoring process should be transparent to the interviewers and while the final decision will be made by the hiring manager – all should be well aware of what they are interviewing about and how they should be presenting the opportunity to the candidate.\n\n\n\r\nInterviews are not often thought about from the candidate’s perspective, but it should be the key component of the process. Ask what does the candidate achieve from each person they meet, and do they get a better organization picture and see themselves within the business?\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNothing is perfect\n\n\n\r\nNobody is perfect, least of all an organization that has multiple cogs and wheels affecting performance. People are not put off by gaining an understanding of what needs to change in a business, or key issues that are affecting the company’s performance. Indeed, candidates see this as a positive, as an opportunity “to add value” if they join. At a point in the interview process, it is beneficial for all to be transparent and be seen as genuine.\n\n\n\r\nAt the risk of sounding repetitive, interviewers and other decision makers often want to present and support the corporate line. In doing so, they may perpetuate the corporate arrogance that is so unattractive to prospective candidates.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2971)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

This August, the occupied population totaled 91.6 million, or a 11.2% higher contingent if compared to the same period of last year.\nAfter the seasonal adjustment\n it was noted that in August 2021 there happened not only an increase of 1.8% in the occupational base but also the highest increase in the pool since February 2020. As a consequence of this scenario of improvement in the occupied population, the rate of unemployment has dropped from 14.7% down to12.8% in August 2021.\nInvestment Growth Indicators confirm a 4.4% increase\n in the “moving quarter” that ended this August, says IPEA in regard to their “Fixed Capital Gross Formation” continuous research study, as a result of an increase of 0.1% between August and July 2021. Comparison of the same periods in 2020 shows an increase of 28.9% in August and a growth of 28.8% in the moving quarter.\nIn terms of the last 12 months, accumulated investment growth rate raised by 19.6%. \nInvestments in the Fixed Capital Goods Segment\n– machines and equipment in general, indicate a 12-month growth rate of 30.2%, despite a drop of 9.9% in the 3rd moving quarter of 2021. National goods production accounted for an increase of 25.2% and imported goods; 39.4%, as compared to the previous 12-month period.\nAccording to IPEA/DIMAC (Macroeconomic Policies and Studies Directorate), Investments in the Civil Construction Segment have experienced a period of six consecutive months of growth, representing a 12.8% in this moving quarter, and a 14.5% growth in the last 12 months.\nIT Cost Variation Index\n methodology introduced by IPEA in January 2013 to measure IT cost evolution in Brazil, considers 8 basic factors: People, Other professional services, Workspace/office rentals, All other operating expenses, Communication, Electrical energy, Depreciation & amortization, Consumption material.\nThe highest impact in this cost variance was item nº 4 –\n All other operating expenses, which varied + 5.57%. Thus far, for these last 12 months – from August 2020 to August 2021, cost variation increased by 7.81, as against and official IBGE inflation rate of 9.68% for the same period.\nAgribusiness Foreign Trade\n– The commercial foreign trade balance for this third quarter of 2021 has generated superavit of US$ 10.1 billion. Export commodity prices went up 38.6%, whilst volume decreased by 16.4%, resulting in an increase of 15.8% in total export value.\nCommodities were traded with higher prices\n – keeping the current trend for the main commodity export portfolio comprising of soybean, grains, such as corn, bovine beef, and pork meat, mainly, sugar and coffee.\nKey export products for the first semester of 2021 included\n – coffee, sugar, cotton, and pork meat. Climate changes caused decrease/shortages in crops, involving part of the second 2021 corn crop\nThe commercialization of all such commodities world-wide\n– has a direct and significant participation of Brazil, and the decrease in volume of these export items may directly impact future prices, as in the case of The Taplow Group S.A. 45, avenue de la Liberte L-1931 Luxembourg www.taplowgroup.com coffee export. Other products such as pig meat and chicken have increased in the course of this year and China keeps importing pork meat heavily from Brazil, due to their drastic decrease in production of this high protein-content product.\n \n Tacito Bocaiuva | Managing Partner, Brazil | E: \ntbocaiuva@taplowgroup.com \nUSA\n \nSupply Chain Issues, Demand, Politics, and Inflation are driving the North American Markets: \nOverview\n The North American economies have been hit by the highest inflation in almost 30 years over the last 10 months.\nPerhaps the most interesting aspect is that US Economists are noting\n a major difference between what consumers are thinking and what they are actually doing. The large financial rating agencies seem to be in relative accord in their views.\nConsumer sentiment as measured by several assessments looks fairly depressed\n– This would seem to indicate a lower level of spending on what are referred to as consumer durables – appliances, residential properties, and vehicles. Consumer spending seems to be growing but the cost of consumer staples and oil-based products is a reasonable worry for most households.\nHowever, recently published surveys appear to suggest consumers seem to be pretty confident\n about future spending. The dichotomy is very interesting as we still have a worker shortage, and it isn’t due to support from governments or other social programs. Rather, the cost of childcare (and in some cases elder care) as well as the fears of being in close contact with others due to continued fears about Covid and recent variants even amongst the vaccinated seems to influence return to work decision making.\nThe global issue of supply chain breakdowns is still plaguing almost all economies\n but is most noticeable in the Americas where we rely on foreign production across the entire spectrum of products and production. As well, the cost of some components – particularly for circuits boards and the like is a major concern.\nConsumer prices are rising faster than wages –\n On November 10th, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that the CPI – consumer price index – increased by 6.2% for the 12 months ending in October which is the biggest jump since 1990. The index, if you do not include food and energy which are very volatile, rose by 4.6% which is the biggest jump since 1991. The jump in October was approximately 9% which largely reflects the cost of higher energy expenses, particularly automotive gasoline and diesel fuel used for trucking appearing in consumer good. The press on the development and efficiency of EVs (Electric Vehicles) continues to point out the risk of production disruption from “chip” shortages as well as electric power production and distribution.\nDue to a belief by a large segment of the population that Covid Vaccines are in some way harmful\n– or at least a large sub-set of US workers either does not believe that Covid is real or that government has the right to mandate vaccination – we are still dealing with a large number of new cases and hospitalizations. There is a theme developing which is that individuals get careless about disease prevention as the number of new cases goes down and then we see spikes during the next 20 days. Often, the reports suggest that some areas are back to the same levels as before the larger number of vaccines was accomplished but not nearly the number of hospitalizations or deaths.\nWe have a troubling degradation of the normally civil discourse between the major political parties as well\n – which is making it very difficult for the executive branch of government to move forward with critical infrastructure and other related quality of life improvement investments.\nWe see the impact on employment continuing for the foreseeable future\n – i.e., 3 – 6 months. Due to markets continuing to perform well, the likelihood is that consumers, other than at the lowest income levels, will continue to upgrade their purchasing as well as discretionary spending on entertainment and travel. Barring a major geopolitical event, very few of the well know economist seem troubled by the current environment although many are concerned about the continuing inflationary pressures and the uncertainty caused by our political issues. We have not seen a major change in demand for executive and senior professionals as various reports are reporting a larger number of executive levels employees opting for early retirement.\nOutcomes to be determined over the next few months\n– a recent spurt of corporate breakups such as GE has announced along with lesser known but significant businesses across a variety of business types, a growing need for mid-level executive and professionals.\n \n Steve Schrenzel | Managing Partner, USA | E: \nsschrenzel@taplowes.com \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (5301)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

With this acute talent shortage and talent ‘war’ going on in the industry, organizations should know how to focus on the ‘passive’ candidates for their leadership and executive positions.\r\n\n\n\n\r\nOur \nexecutive search services\n would help you find the right set of passive talent and we believe that these candidates would bring a lot of skills, experiences, and innovation to the table. Passive candidates are those who are not actively looking out for jobs. They are not the typical #opentowork folks. Hence, you need specialized services to show them why your organization is the best fit for them and persuade them to leave their comfort zones and join your organization. The task seems daunting, but this is where our \n executive recruitment consultants\n would help in convincing candidates that the grass is indeed greener on the other side.\r\n\n\r\nHere are the primary things that we focus on to tap into the passive talent pool –\r\n\r\n\nDoing our homework \n\r\nBefore approaching a candidate for a C-suite position or leadership position our \n executive search consultant \ndoes research to find out what they are doing in their current role, what are the benefits offered, and what is salary drawn? This helps us define what is it that you can use to compel them to leave their present role and join you. At the same time, we make sure that the person we have identified has the right set of skills and experience, is not just evaluated based on popularity or public opinion. Once the homework is done, our pitch becomes precise, and we can make targeted communications\r\n\r\n\nOffering flexible working hours and competitive salary\n\r\nIn the new normal, the hybrid mode of work is here to stay and as employers, you must offer the same to the candidate. As a c-suite leader, the person would surely love to have flexible work hours and locations alongside a pretty good and handsome salary. Now, only salary would not lure someone especially for the top positions. Hence, we need to highlight the benefits and perks that come along. We design our communication to shine a spotlight on the work culture, work-life balance, diversity and inclusivity practices, and the core values of your organization.\r\n\r\n\nLeveraging technology\n\r\nThe entire world is moving and witnessing disruptions due to technological advancements. The best way to stay ahead is by leveraging them to the best of their abilities. Our \n executive recruitment consultants\n use advanced AI, ML algorithms to target candidates on social media, gather data about candidates, and follow their activities. This would help you screen and filter candidates in an accelerated manner. Besides, it would save you time and effort and you can focus on the above areas to strengthen your position as a recruiter.\r\n\r\nThese days organizations are hunting for candidates. If you want the best set of people to lead your organization, then you must tap into the massive pool of candidates. You must leverage our \n executive search management consulting\n expertise and stay one step ahead in the game.

It has more to do with an organization’s ability to get around and align on a common vision and fulfil that vision effectively to stay ahead of the competition.\nFor example, in the context of a human body, if one is sick, one can keep on taking medicines to get better or one can create systems where the environment is clean, diet is healthy, and one is getting enough sleep and exercise to not to fall sick. For organizations, this translates into creating core values, formulating growth plans both, long and short term, and implementing periodic check-ins with all employees.\nHistorically, leaders relied on intuition to gauge how healthy or unhealthy their organization was. However, today organizational health index is a measure of organizational elements that help drive organizational performance. Research indicates that healthy companies are more than twice as likely to outperform their peers.\nIn order to succeed in today’s competitive landscape, organizations must plan for team success, formulate an action plan, and implement regular communication. At The Taplow Group we have extensive experience in designing, delivering, and benchmarking organizational health projects in addition to human capital services, to ensure that leaders fully realize their organization’s full potential.

This is not an exhaustive list of activities that the CEO is expected to perform. Like the captain of a ship, the CEO must steer the organization through good and bad times. No doubt, you must select the best person for this role. No organization would stand and stay ahead in this dynamic business world if it is not led by a dynamic and capable CEO.\n\n\nWhat are the roles and responsibilities of a CEO? Can you list them down? CEO does not operate at a micro-level and hence it would be difficult to list down the activities. Rather, a CEO works at a macro level and some of the overall areas that he/she should focus on are – \n\n\nGive a strategic direction to the organization\n\n\nA CEO should have a clear vision in mind. This vision is not a fancy statement but the result of a thorough assessment of the market, the organization’s potentials, and a deep competitive analysis. \nCEO recruiters\n often focus on candidates with deep industry experience and exceptional managerial skills. These are the persons who can be agile and strategic in their decision-making.\n\n\nThe public face for the organization\n\n\nA CEO is like the public face of the organization. When you think of Facebook, the first public image that comes to mind is that of the CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Similar is the case with Tesla or Amazon. This means that the CEO attends product launches, press conferences, making a successful presence on television, radio, and social media. What if appearing in public is not someone’s cup of tea. This is where \nCertified CEO training programs\n come into the picture. These services trains and groom CEO and prepare them to become the public face of the company.\n\n\nTake care of all the stakeholders\n\n\nWhenever you approach any \nCEO search services,\n one parameter that they focus on while selecting candidates is the person’s ability to report and create alignment with the stakeholders, primarily the board of directors and the investors. The authority of the CEO on the board is subjective, varies from one organization to another but his reporting abilities, ability to bring everyone on the same page, respect ideas, and making everyone understand the vision he carries, are very critical to the long-term success of the organization.\n\n\nNetworking\n\n\nIt is said that your net worth is your network. A CEO must establish relations with vendor partners, take part in events and conferences, discover new business opportunities, and establish a solid business network giving the organization its next big breakthrough.\n\n\nThese are some of the broad areas that a CEO should look into. But the overall responsibilities go far beyond these listed ones. CEO is the highest-ranking executive officer, and you cannot afford a slight mistake in their selection. Use our CEO search services and certified CEO training program to select the best candidate and then groom them into the leader your organization is seeking.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group we not only help you source the best-fit for your organization’s leadership through our executive search consultants but also train and develop them to hone their skills.

It’s now close to two years that employees are working remotely and are desperate to get back to the office. A recent report by Censuswide that worked with 1108 respondents who were working remotely since the onset of the pandemic shows that every 9 out of 10 (86%) of the Indian workforce believes that a hybrid work model is essential for maintaining a healthy work-life balance.\n\n\n\r\nThe study has clearly highlighted that the workforce is struggling with burnouts, stress, and mental fatigue due to the remote working model. Half of the workforce has stressed the importance of work-life balance, equating them to be equally important as their salaries. The respondents state that a hybrid model would help them focus on both their personal and professional lives. 7 in 10 professionals think that remote working is negatively impacting their growth, performance, and learning. There is a clear consensus that people want to come back to the office to strike a balance, not to miss out on the watercooler conversations, fun, and outings.\n\n\n\r\nThe remote model is not filled with only cons, there have been respondents who said that they have been able to maintain a healthy diet, find more time to exercise, and choose their own work time and location, owing to the remote model. But the majority, 9 in 10 professionals are eagerly looking forward to coming back to the office and continuing with a hybrid model in the near future.\n\r\n*Source: LinkedIn's \"Future of Work\" Study 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3434)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

The events of the past year and a half have impacted the way organizations are identifying talent, recruiting, and onboarding them. The entire model of global executive search has undergone a massive change. New trends that were never thought of, became the new normal. To stay ahead in the dynamic landscape of business, organizations must be aware of these new trends, must adopt them, and continue to implement novel ideas to grow and expand.\nExecutive search\n is about identifying and hiring the top executive management for an organization. In other words, it is all about selecting the cream of the leadership or the top management. Here you cannot afford to stay behind or make mistakes. Hence, it is almost imperative that you keep yourself updated with the top trends in \n global executive search.\n \nBuild your brand\n \nBranding is not only about how your clients perceive you. It is also about how present and potential employees perceive your work culture and environment. Do employees feel motivated and valued? Are potential candidates attracted by your work culture and are looking for opportunities to work with you? In the coming years, employees would expect complete transparency across all processes, starting from recruitment. The key is to build your own brand, where you would be known for promoting a conducive, friendly, and supportive work environment\n \nFocus on DIB\n \nDIB stands for diversity, inclusion, and belonging. Have you implemented these facets into your work culture and recruitment processes? In the future, a potential candidate would choose to commit to an organization that promotes diversity, gives equal opportunities to the under-represented communities, and is committed to bringing social change.\n \nPay attention to employee engagement\n \nThe remote model of work has increased mental fatigue, stress, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. Does your company go beyond the traditional means of employee engagement? A prospective candidate would love to know more about his life beyond work and related commitments. Candidates would evaluate your organization against various engagement activities. You need to foster deep collaborations with teams and across so that employees remain engaged and feel deeply valued\n \nAdopt technology in recruitment\n \nThe last year has hastened the pace at which this space was adopting technology. A lot of organizations are using AI, chatbots, virtual connecting models for hiring and onboarding. You need to find the digital solutions that would provide the best experience to your prospective candidates. Refine your \n global executive search\n strategies while incorporating digital elements into them.\n \nFlexible working model\n \nYou should give your employees the flexibility to choose their work models, whether they want to work remotely or from the office, or a mix of both.

Introduction of online collaboration tools support in bringing cohesion among employees of the companies that are ahead of the curve. However, a strategy for successful adoption of technology is usually absent that affects productivity and increases pitfalls. For instance, if one department uses a certain tool and another department is unaware of its existence, the overall output might reduce; or when a particular technology is not sanctioned to be used by senior employees, it could lead to security risks (known as Shadow IT). Therefore, when a new technological intervention is rolled out, it needs to cater to a variety of parameters, for example: the technical know-how of the end-users or the diversity in teams with respect to culture, backgrounds and working styles. To start with, organizations can emphasize on easy-to-use applications to cover the basic need of staying connected via video conferencing. Tools such as Slack support casual discussions while WebEx takes care of large-scale meetings. For management of tasks or projects, Wrike or Trello allow teams to edit documents in real-time, manage to-dos through dashboards and manage reviews and approvals. Along with work, learning and recognition offers huge motivation to the work force. Online learning platforms offer self-paced learning for upskilling; and applications like Bucketlist are being used to enhance performance through gamification. A thorough need-analysis will eliminate drawbacks at a later stage. Whatever tool suits the needs of an entity best, it can be ensured that it is easy-to-use. A primer is essential to take care of the needs of technologically less-savvy workers. This will establish well-integrated cohesion among the work force and the organization will experience enhanced engagement, commitment, and collaboration as sustainable benefits in the long run.\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2812)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Honda Motor globally has announced plans to launch three new EVs for personal use by 2024.\nUS-based consumer electronics brand Westinghouse Electric Corporation has forayed into the Indian market \n and has launched a range of its TV sets here. The brand has come here in collaboration with its Indian licensing partner Super Plastronics Pvt Ltd (SPPL) with whom it has entered into an exclusive licensing agreement. The brand will operate into the affordable segment of the LED TV and aims to gain a market share of 3-5% by the end of next year, SPPL said in a statement. As per the licensing contract, Westinghouse's manufacturing, branding, designing, packaging, and retailing supply chain will be handled by SPPL.\n \n Contact: Sangeeta Sabharwal, Managing Partner, India E: \nsangeeta.sabharwal@taplowgroupindia.com\nNew Zealand \n \nLabour Market\n:\nThe recent NZIER Quarterly Survey of Business Opinion showed that 42% of respondents intended to take on more labour. This is not only a record high but consistent with annual employment growth soaring to above 5.0%. A net 45% of respondents also expect that labour turnover will rise. This is 28 percentage points higher than the previous record, back in 1973. If this is the expectation of business, it is highly likely heightened demand for wage growth will be met. Tightness in the labour market is further confirmed by the net 72% of businesses who state that skilled labour is getting harder to find. This is a record high level in a survey that dates back to 1975.\nShortages of unskilled labour are not so extreme but at a net 52% remain problematically high. The degree of shortage is consistent with the unemployment rate dropping aggressively lower. To round things off, labour remains the biggest factor constraint that firms are facing and the 28% of companies reporting labour is their biggest problem is the highest reading since September 1974. \nSource – BNZ Economy Watch \nVaccination Rates still not at the Desired Level\nCurrently, just over 40% of the population is fully vaccinated (Westpac Bank use the total population estimates from Statistics New Zealand, rather than the eligible population figures from the Ministry of Health). That proportion will rise sharply in the coming weeks, as people come due for their second dose – around two-thirds have had at least their first jab. But both modelling and overseas experience suggest that more will be needed to be able to reopen the New Zealand border safely.\nFuture Outlook\nWestpac bank concludes that managing Covid successfully will require a combination of high vaccination rates and other public health measures on an ongoing basis. As New Zealand moves beyond the need for Covid restrictions, the pressures that the economy had been facing in recent months will come to the fore again. The latest GDP figures confirmed that demand was running hot over the first half of the year, with a 2.8% jump in the June quarter on top of a 1.4% rise in the March quarter. The level of GDP is now 4.3% higher than it was at the end of 2019. That’s essentially the same extent of growth that Westpac bank were forecasting before the pandemic, despite the absence of overseas tourists and a smaller population than New Zealand would have otherwise had (as net migration has shrunk to near zero).\nPressures in the labour market have been especially apparent. In the first instance this might seem to be a supply-side constraint – the closure of the border has cut off access to migrant workers. But strong outright growth in employment in recent months shows that this is more of a demand-side story. Even with the current restrictions, job advertisements have been comparable to pre-pandemic levels.\nOther Pressures Building\nThere is also a growing risk that recent inflation pressures prove to be more persistent. As seen globally, a range of supply-side pressures – including disruptions to supply chains, rising energy prices, and soaring shipping costs – have boosted inflation in the near term. In a strong demand environment, these forces could be the catalyst for broader, more persistent price pressures in the domestic economy.\nThe past few weeks have seen cost pressures in the economy continuing to build. Much of this is a result of ongoing supply-side factors, such as disruptions to global manufacturing and shipping. That’s resulted in shortages of some items and has seen the landed prices for many consumer goods and productive inputs rising rapidly in recent months.\nImportantly, Westpac Bank think that those supply side disruptions are set to become more pronounced. Manufacturers globally are reporting ongoing difficulties sourcing chips and other components. And on top of that, shipping companies are expected to divert capacity towards markets in the Asia and Northern Hemisphere ahead of the Black Friday, Christmas and Lunar New Year shopping periods. Here in New Zealand, that combination signals ongoing difficulties sourcing some goods ahead of the holiday shopping season, along with continued upwards pressure on shipping costs and goods prices. \nSource – Westpac Economy Watch Updates September/October 2021\n Contact: Graeme Sandri, Managing Partner, New Zealand E: \ngraeme@swr.nz \nSingapore \n \nSingapore's economy expanded at a slower annual pace in the third quarter \n compared with the previous three-month period when growth was boosted by a low-base effect. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) unexpectedly tightened monetary policy at its half-yearly review in October. Market watchers like DBS senior rates strategist Eugene Loew pointed out that the MAS’ shift mirrors that of other central banks across the world.\nThe move bucked market consensus \n Most watchers had expected the central bank to only start policy normalisation in April next year, given global concerns about economic recovery amid the spread of the more contagious Delta variant.\nThe Gross domestic product rose by 6.5 percent on a year-on-year basis \n in the July-September period, moderating from 15.2 percent growth in the previous quarter, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Thursday.\nThe pace of growth was weaker than the forecast of 7 percent by the economists\n in a Monetary Authority of Singapore survey last month, while a Bloomberg poll had predicted a 6.6 percent expansion.

However, the pandemic has shed a considerable amount of light on the importance of work-life balance and having a happy mind. The pandemic didn’t just blur the lines between what constitutes our personal and professional lives, but it also brought with it plenty of stress, anxiety, and uncertainty. All these feelings added to our mental health deterioration on several levels. A report by Oracle claimed 76% of employees believe their organizations could be doing more to cater to their mental health needs. WFH culture led to a higher burnout rate which resulted in a dip in both, productivity, and satisfaction.\n\n\n\r\nEven with the right intentions, several organizations struggle with a big question of where to start. A good place to begin your focus on mental health in a professional setting could be to set guidelines to enable a healthier work culture.\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Care Indulgence\n\r\nSometimes, it’s good to waste time. You don’t constantly need to practice hustle culture and organizations should have employees manage stress in an effective and healthy manner. Also, keep in mind your employees are human, not machines. So let them take a break when they feel like.\n\n\n\n\nConsiderate tone\n\n\nEveryone is going through the various effects of this pandemic together. Hence, consider being nicer in your communication.\n\n\n\n\nCommunicate often and sympathetically \n\r\nDon’t just check up on deadlines and follow ups, check up on your employees’ mental health status. Ask them if you can contribute in any way or make their lives easier.\n\n\n\n\nDon’t be rigid\n\r\nEmployees also have families & a personal life cater to. So, be flexible with deadlines and take away the added stress of unmet deadlines and overdue work.\n\n\n\n\nPrioritize work life balance\n\r\nOnce employees log off, let them be. Don’t take away from their families and me time. If they wind down well, they’ll be far more productive and concentrated the next day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3645)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

In order to stay competitive, organizations must align their human resource strategies with the latest trends and stay relevant to the needs of both, the current and potential employees. Technology has been a game changer, especially in the last couple of years. It has made leaders rethink their \n human capital development \napproach to redefine their employee experience.\nHere’s a look at 5 trends that are going to have a major impact on human capital development and management, now and in the near future.\nHarnessing Technology to Enhance Human Experience\nTechnology might seem like a substitute to jobs but if we were to look at it smartly, it can help organizations augment work and add a human touch to day-to-day activities. Even with the perennial evolution of technology, jobs can be recreated instead of replaced. An intelligent revisit to AI is the need of the hour to put humans back into the picture with decision-making at the core of their work.\nMaking Compassion a Priority\nFor leaders who believe that the head is all they need to manage people or run a company, it should be noted that the heart is equally important. Compassion is that quality of a leader that ensures great profitability of a company in the long run. Every action by an employee, if mixed with compassion, will produce ripple effects that will touch all the stakeholders in a way that guarantees sustainability. If the core values already include compassion, make sure the leaders display it without fail so they can exemplify their behavior for an overall impact on the culture. Organizations must engage a \n human resources consulting firm\n to source compassionate leaders to help drive employee engagement.\nCustomizing Learning and Development\nA fixed structure or routine to fulfilling an employee’s learning needs might not be the best way to upskill. With the changing needs of the business, it is essential that learning be personalized and driven by employees for themselves. An ecosystem where learning becomes self-driven will build a strong foundation for ages to come. It’s time the employees take charge of their growth; not needed to be pushed by managers or learning department.\nUtilizing Design Thinking in Solving Problems\nDesign Thinking is an iterative process in which we attempt to understand the user, challenge assumptions, and redefine problems. Solutions that might not be perceivable at surface level understanding can be built through this methodology. It can be integrated into every facet of the employee life cycle and can help organizations reboot their human capital search.\nTeam Creation for Employees, By Employees\nTeams that have incompatible members working together often affect the output negatively. What if team creation could have a say of the employees? If they are free to choose whom to work with, it is least likely to have low productivity or quality. DIY teams are also proportional to less grievances and increased happiness quotient of the company.\nWith these emerging trends in \n Human Capital Development\n, it is certain that organizations with traditional approaches have to offer more, taking their practices a notch higher to develop employees and bring out the best in them.\nAt The Taplow Group we not only help you source the best-fit for your organization’s leadership through our \nexecutive search consultants\n but also train and develop them to hone their skills.

But one thing that remains consistent is that behind every successful organization is an effective board. Organizational performance is directly related to the board effectiveness and if you have a strong board in place, you can navigate smoothly through the most difficult of situations.\n\n\n\r\nThis is where you need an exceptional \n board governance services firm.\n The experienced consultants at the board governance services firm understand the industry dynamics and not only help to pick the right board members but also help them put their best performances forward. Before we dive into what makes a great board, we should understand what is a great board? The definitions might vary but the underlying concept is the same – a great board is one where all members are aligned on the organization’s vision, mission, and have a clear understanding of resource allocation. We believe that it boils down to the competence of the members, the character or integrity they bring in, their business acumen and industry know-how or competence, and finally the chemistry; the way all the members work together as a team and not as individuals.\n\n\n\r\nJust like there are four pillars of a great board, there are four corners that make a great board.\n\n\n\n\nQuality of discussion\n\r\nIf your board members have a quality debate, question the status quo, and are ready to take tough decisions, then your board is on the right track. At a board level, it is not about the process, it is about thinking and questioning, and the ones who do it the best wins the game. It does not matter who the board members are as individuals, what matters is how they function together when placed as a team with a single vision.\n\n\n\n\nDiversity\n\r\nOur \nboard governance services\n in tandem with our global executive search consultants firm aim to bring diversity and innovation to the table. With a diverse team, you can expect a better quality of dialogue and hence better results. The consultants at our \n global executive search consultants firm \n look beyond the surface and dig deep into the backgrounds, experiences, nature of people before recommending them to the board. With diversity in its truest form, your board would mention it at its best.\n\n\n\n\nEvaluations\n\r\nBoard members must evaluate themselves and their peers. But the big question is, what should be the parameters to get evaluated upon. This is where experts can help. We have designed effective evaluation guidelines and processes and would customize them according to your organization and industry. A transparent and comprehensive evaluation of all members would help the board identify the gaps in the team and how the entire team can up their game a notch higher.\n\n\n\n\nCEO evaluation and succession\n\r\nThe most crucial decision that the board has to take is regarding CEO succession. The board has to evaluate a CEO and decide on whether they need a successor. Once again, what would be the parameters and KPIs? As a robust board governance services firm, we are designed to cover every single aspect of what it takes to make a great broad.\n\n\n\r\nIf you want to create an effective board that would ensure that your organization reaches its zenith, then connect with us today, and experience the best board governance service in the industry.\n\n\n\r\nAt The Taplow Group we help you source the best-fit for your organization’s leadership through our \n executive search consultants.\n To know more about our services like leadership coaching, professional hiring, management consulting, reach out to us at \n www.taplowgroup.com\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3312)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Nevertheless, the containment of the epidemic is now mainly based on the expansion of vaccination coverage (79% of the French population over 12 years old was vaccinated on September 6), which greatly reduces the economic impact of the virus. In July and August 2021, economic activity, considered as a whole, would have continued to progress, to be relatively close to its pre-crisis level: between -1% and -0.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to approximately -30% in April 2020 (first wave), -7% in November 2021 (second wave), and -6% in April 2021 (third wave).\n\n\nIn the absence of any further deterioration in the health situation, the recovery would continue till the end of the year (+0.5% expected in the fourth quarter),\n allowing the economy to return to its pre-crisis level overall, despite persistent sectoral contrasts. Overall, average annual growth would amount to 6,25 % in 2021 (after -8.0% in 2020).\n\n\nAt the same time, however, hiring pressures are trending upwards.\n When asked in July, in business surveys, around 15% of companies in the industry and services and 40% of those in construction said that were limited in their production by insufficient staff. These relatively high proportions are, however, lower than the high points of 2018-2019. They are consistent with the strength of private sector employment in the second quarter, which returned to its pre-crisis level in June.\n\n\nPour la première fois depuis le début de la crise sanitaire, l’intensification de la circulation du virus n’a pas provoqué de recul marqué de l’activité économique\n\n\nEn juillet et août 2021, la situation sanitaire s’est dégradée en France : la circulation du variant Delta de Covid-19 s’est intensifiée, occasionnant une quatrième vague épidémique. Néanmoins, l’endiguement de l’épidémie s’appuie désormais principalement sur l’élargissement de la couverture vaccinale (79% de la population française de plus de 12 ans était vaccinée au 6 septembre), ce qui réduit très fortement l’impact économique du virus. En juillet et en août 2021, l’activité économique, considérée dans sa globalité, aurait ainsi continué à progresser, pour se retrouver relativement proche de son niveau d’avant-crise : entre – 1 et – 0,5 % par rapport au quatrième trimestre 2019, contre environ – 30 % en avril 2020 (première vague), – 7 % en novembre 2021 (deuxième vague), et – 6 % en avril 2021 (troisième vague).\n\n\nEn l’absence de nouvelle dégradation de la situation sanitaire, la reprise se poursuivrait en fin d’année (+ 0,5 % prévu au quatrième trimestre), permettant alors à l’économie de retrouver globalement son niveau d’avantcrise, malgré des contrastes sectoriels persistants. Au total, la croissance en moyenne annuelle s’élèverait à 6,25 % en 2021 (après – 8,0 % en 2020).\n\n\nEn parallèle cependant, les tensions sur les recrutements tendent à progresser. Interrogées en juillet dans les enquêtes de conjoncture INSEE, environ 15 % des entreprises de l’industrie et des services et 40 % de celles du bâtiment se déclaraient limitées dans leur production par l’insuffisance de personnel. Ces proportions relativement élevées sont toutefois inférieures aux points hauts de 2018-2019. Elles vont de pair avec la vigueur de l’emploi salarié privé au deuxième trimestre, qui a retrouvé dès juin son niveau d’avant-crise.\n\n\nStephane Martinod\n\n\nManaging Partner, France\n\n\nE: \nsmartinod@taplowgroup.com\n\n\n \n\n\nFINLAND\n\n\n\n\nThere is growth of external capital in Finland\n, especially in real estate sector. Global real estate investors come in with money and start new developments with higher risk.\n\n\nStartup funding is available more than ever now which we see in our business as increase of assignments for CxO roles in these companies\n\n\nHowever, as promising as the rise of economy has been during 2021, we see \nmore hesitation in decision making of large corporations in investing to new businesses and subsequent director roles\n\n\nDuring the second half of 2021 there has been almost a record-breaking number of IPO´s\n in the Finnish market, especially to First North. First North is a Nordic marketplace for smaller companies with less regulation than Nasdaq OMX.\n\n\n\n\nTimo Toivanen\n\n\nManaging Partner, Finland\n\n\nE: \ntimo.toivanen@taplow.fi\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGERMANY\n\n\nEconomic output in Germany is set for strong expansion in the third quarter,\n at a rate that will far surpass the growth recorded in the previous three months. The main reason for this is the considerable easing of COVID-19 containment measures from mid-May, which is having a stronger and, in particular, more prolonged impact in the current quarter than in the previous one. The main sectors to benefit from the loosening of restrictions are services sectors that were hit especially hard, such as hotel and restaurant services, travel services and parts of the bricks-and-mortar retailsector. In industry and the main construction sector, order books are well filled.\n\n\nThere are initial signs that the supply bottlenecks for certain intermediate goods and commodities are at least not worsening as significantly as they were in the second quarter.\n The infrastructure and production capacity destroyed in the areas affected by the flood disaster represent an additional, but from a macroeconomic perspective, probably a manageable drag on the economy. All in all, it remains to be seen whether GDP will reach its pre-crisis level in the third quarter already or whether this will be a fourth quarter event. There is uncertainty surrounding the further economic impact of the pandemic. For example, the Delta variant and vaccination slowdown could result in tighter restrictions being reimposed. However, this could then be expected to weigh more heavily on the economy in the fourth quarter.\n\n\nRegistered unemployment has recently fallen significantly.\n In the second quarter of 2021, it declined by 26,000 people in seasonally adjusted terms, or 0.1 percentage point. Unemployment only began to decline significantly in June and then fell very sharply in July, decreasing by 0.2 percentage point to its present level of 5.7%. The leading indicators for the labour market currently suggest that employment will continue to recover over the next few months. The ifo Employment Barometer, which reflects recruitment plans in trade and industry for the next three months, is well into expansionary territory, as is the employment barometer of the Institute for Employment Research (IAB).\n\n\nThe number of vacancies has recently seen fairly reliable growth,\n already returning to its level of the fourth quarter of 2019, which had, however, been subdued by the economic slowdown. The IAB’s unemployment barometer is currently at its most favorable level ever.\n\n\nGovernment finances continue to provide a high level of support to the economy in 2021.\n However, the economic upturn will have a positive knock-on effect on government finances as the year progresses, and support measures will become less significant. In 2021 as a whole, the deficit is likely to grow further and exceed 5% of GDP (2020: 4.5%). It should be noted, though, that this will be driven largely by measures not connected to the coronavirus crisis, e.g., the partial abolition of the solidarity surcharge.\n\n\nInflation rose further in July.\n Annual inflation surged overall from 2.1% to 3.1%, as price levels in the same month of the previous year were down markedly due to the temporary reduction in VAT rates. The reported rate of inflation will increase further as the year goes on. As things currently stand, inflation rates of between 4% and 5% are possible at the end of the year. Inflation is likely to stabilize again, to a marked extent, in early 2022.\n\n\nSource: Deutsche Bundesbank\n\n\nGermany’s Next Steps\n\n\nFederal Electionsare due onSep 26th, 2021. Angela Merkel’s 16-year chancellorship comes to an end.\n\n\nEconomic Challenges\n\n\nGermany’s economic performance is still below the level before the crisis. The race to catch up is slower than in China, the USA or parts of the EU.\n\n\nEven before Corona, industry was struggling to cope with digital transformation and stringent climate protection requirements, and now bottlenecks in chips and key raw materials are putting the brakes on. Some orders also remain unfilled due to a demographic shortage of skilled workers and young talent.\n\n\nEconomic Opportunities\n\n\nMcKinsey: Germany could double growth by 2030. Fabian Billing, head of Germany at McKinsey, said, “Germany needs creative renewal. Disruptive, radically new solutions as well as technology expertise are an important basis for this.” It’s not the preservation of the status quo, but new beginnings and the opportunities they bring that will allow us to continue to participate in progress and opportunity in the spirit of the social market economy.”\n\n\nAgainst this background, McKinsey has identified fields of action, e.g.:\n\n\n\n\nTop companies: cross-sector growth\n\n\nMedium-sized companies: The previous pure hardware producers must additionally develop software and system controls and integrate the new products into the Internet of Things.\n\n\nusiness startups and investments\n\n\nContinuing education: A new education system, “lifelong learning”\n\n\nPolitics: Ensure framework + holistic regulation = planning security for the economy\n\n\nSource: www.finanznachrichten.de / Dow Jones News\n\n\n\n\nPeter Knoblich\n\n\nManaging Partner, Germany\n\n\nE: \npknoblich@taplowgroup.com\n\n\n \n\n\nNORWAY\n\n\nExport and trade-balance in Q3 is at an all-time high in Norway. \nIt is partly related to increased price of natural gas, but positive trends are also seen in several on shore industries.\n\n\n\n\nGDP 2020 down 0.8% to € 63.450,-(per capita)\n\n\nPublic spending as part of GDP increased 4.5%\n\n\nGDP in Q1 and Q2 2021, increased by 1.2 %, back to 2019 level.\n\n\n\n\nInformation by Statistics Norway\n\n\nReal Estate and construction is experiencing a slight slow-down,\n as people’s new arrangement for settlement after covid-19 needs to be confirmed. There is uncertainty around people’s preferences to still live very central, or if many inhabitants are more willing to move out from cities.\n\n\nGovernment election on Sept’13th has resulted in a change of government\n which will take place in October. After 8 years with conservative leadership, Norway will get a socialist/ labor government (as expected). Environmentalist did not receive expected good results and will not get an impact on politics. This calmed the financial markets, and business leaders look positively to the future.\n\n\nElectrification of the society is still on high gear\n, and many interesting business-opportunities arises as a result. Energy in general, sun, wind, water, gas, oil, is still a major focus for Norwegian exports.\n\n\nAlso looking for the fishing industry to bounce back to 2019 levels soon. There is still some uncertainty related to the tourist industry, and airliners in particular. This will probably take 12 more months to stabilize.\n\n\nHans Holter-Sorensen\n\n\nManaging Partner, Norway\n\n\nE: \nhhs@taplow.no\n\n\n \n\n\nRUSSIA\n\n\nIn 2020 the Russian GDP decreased by 3.1 %. \nThe annual GDP forecast for Russia is to rise by 3.8% in 2021,\n according to the IMF. Air transportation suffered the most in 2020, they reported almost 50% revenue loss. Currently the gross domestic product in Russia is estimated to have increased by 4.7 % for July 2021.\n\n\nThe inflation of the RUB become stable on a high level in July 2021. Growth in food prices has decelerated in the summer due to new harvest. Yet, the inflation level remains on the highest level for more than four years. \nThere is a slight expectation on inflation below 6% after the Duma elections in September.\n More significant for the fall below 6% might be due to the moderation of the global economic upturn visible on the raw materials prices.\n\n\nThe Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline construction was stopped due to US sanctions.\n The Swiss contractor company, which delivered unique equipment, was forced to stop. The pipeline was supposed to be completed by the end of 2019. Now the project has been completed on the 10th of September 2021 and it is assumed that first gas could be delivered by the end of this year.\n\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by Rabota.ru, 44% of the Russian companies managed to recover from their losses suffered in the crisis brought on by the corona virus.\n 27% remain partly recovered and 11% are still in the midst of it (one year ago the number was 36%).\n\n\nHenric Nilsson\n\n\nManaging Partner, Russia\n\n\nE: \nhenric.nilsson@humansearch.ru\n\n\n \n\n\nSPAIN\n\n\nThe Spanish government confirmed its economic growth forecast for this year and the next, based on the pace of recovery following the end of most coronavirus mobility restrictions and the good pace of the Covid-19 vaccination drive. \nThe Cabinet said that GDP will grow 6.5% in 2021 and 7% in 2022\n, in line with previous forecasts. In 2022, Spain will recover to its pre-pandemic activity and in 2023, it will return to the path of growth we had before the health crisis.\n\n\nThis makes Spain the advanced economy that will expand the most in 2022\n after suffering the biggest setback in 2020, when output fell by a record 10.8%, the biggest decline since the Spanish Civil War.\n\n\nThe labor market overperformed in recent months,\n particularly in June when the jobless rate fell by a record amount. But it is still unclear whether many of the workers who remain on the government’s ERTE job retention scheme will be laid off in the fall, along with workers in the tourism industry who were hired for the summer season.\n\n\nWith a view to draft thenext year’s budget,\n the Cabinet also capped the 2022 spending ceiling at €196.1 billion, a 0.02% rise from the previous year and the highest on record. The €196.1 billion includes €26.4 billion from the EU recovery fund, and Brussels will demand reforms in exchange for that amount.\n\n\nThe Cabinet also addressed the public deficit,\n which last year soared to represent 11% of GDP or around €125 billion. The government is hoping to bring this down to 8.4% in 2021 and 5% in 2022. The government said that the 2022 accounts will shore up its short-term strategy to keep supporting the recovery effort, and in the medium and long term to transform and modernize the Spanish economy to make it more sustainable and resilient.\n\n\nCarmen Alarcon\n\n\nManaging Partner, Spain\n\n\nE: \ncalarcon@taplowgroup.com\n\n\n \n\n\nUK\n\n\nStrong GDP growth of 7.2% in 2021 and 5.5% in 2022 is projected\n as a large share of the population is vaccinated and restrictions to economic activity are progressively eased. Growth is driven by a rebound of consumption, notably of services. GDP is expected to return to its pre-pandemic level in early 2022. However, increased border costs following the exit from the EU Single Market will continue to weigh on foreign trade. Unemployment is expected to peak at the end of 2021 as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is withdrawn. Inflation is set to increase due to past increases in commodity prices and strong GDP growth but should remain below the 2% inflation target.\n\n\nThe UK has seen wage inflation become an issue particularly in the manufacturing, logistics and hospitality sectors,\n primarily due to a shortage of workers from the EU due to Brexit rules along with many people returning to their country of origin. Recently there have been over 1m vacancies listed primarily for shop floor and blue-collarworkers.\n\n\nHousehold savings have increased dramatically.\n Since not all foregone consumption of services has been redirected towards substitutes, that has led households to accumulate savings in excess of £168bn. Although some households saw their incomes fall over the past year, whole economy disposable income stayed broadly flat in 2020, in part cushioned by the government’s income support schemes. As a result, the household saving ratio ended 2020 at 16% of disposable income, having peaked at 26% in 2020 Q2 as lockdown rules were eased and consumer spending started to climb.\n\n\nPublic sector net borrowing roseto 14.3% of GDPin 2020-21\n, the highest proportion of GDP since 1945-46. At £300bn, that was also the highest amount on record, and around double the level it reached at its peak following the Great Recession .The rise in borrowing has so far been a spending story, with higher expenditure accounting for 85% of the increase in the deficit in 2020-21. The total cost of past and planned COVID-related government interventions now amounts to nearly £350bn.\n\n\nBusiness investment is forecasted to rebound strongly in 2021 and 2022,\n driven by the reopening of the economy and the introduction of the super-deduction incentive. However, business investment is projected to slow sharply in 2023 as the super-deduction incentive ends and corporation tax increases\n\n\nMark Firth\n\n\nManaging Partner, UK\n\n\nE: \nmfirth@taplowgroup.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2760)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

The values of the company and the applicant must be met in order for the applicant to remain employed by the company. We found a method to anticipate how well the candidate would enjoy working with the company,\" says \nTimo Jäntti\n, Chairman of the Board of \nTaplow Finland\n.\n\n\n\r\nThe company is now utilizing Team scope’s solution as part of executive searches. The company's management team conducts an approximately 25-minute test to determine their personality type, values, and style of operation. The results are reviewed with a direct search consultant. They help you assess how the dynamics of the management teamwork and what kind of new expertise is needed for the team to go further in the right direction.\n\n\n\r\nAt the end of the leadership recruitment process, the top candidates fill out the same survey. \"Artificial intelligence simulates how each candidate fits into the management team. This helps to differentiate between applicants with a very similar profile from the perspective of substance expertise,\" says \nTimo Jäntti.\n\n\n\r\nThe Taplow Group has also used the method with M&A clients. The management teams of both the buyer company and the purchase target can be assessed using the test and the best possible management team can be built in the merged company. Venture capitalists have also used Taplow's service to assess the management of the target company.\n\n\n\r\nUntil now, the candidate's suitability for culture was being assessed in meetings with a direct search consultant.\n\n\n\r\n\"Experienced direct \nsearch consultants\n are able to make civilized guesses by meeting people, but artificial intelligence brings data to support decision-making,\" says \nTimo Jäntti\n.\n\n\n\r\nThe direct search industry is changing; Timo Jäntti believes that artificial intelligence will change the direct search industry in the next few years. \"Technology is able to play a more significant role, and we find processes that can be fully automated.\" In mass recruitments, artificial intelligence has been utilized for a long time. For example, direct \nsearch consultants\n use a lot of different word searches when looking for suitable candidates for different tasks.\n\n\n\r\n\"The work of direct search consultants will not stop in the next few years, but in a few years' the situation may look different. We want to be at the forefront of technological development.\" According to Timo Jäntti, job search has clearly become professional over the past few years. Applicants' CVs are increasingly appealing as they are skillfully made, and direct search companies also educate people about personal branding.\n\n\n\r\n\"For example, we have trained Aalto University alumni on how to get on to the lists of \ndirect search consultants.\"\n \nTimo Jäntti\n says that the starting point for getting on the head-hunter list is, of course, that you do your job well, but it is also important that your own expertise is expressed in the right terms, whether it is on LinkedIn or in interviews with the media or any other platform for that matter.\n\n\n\r\n\"When a direct search is more data-controlled, certain keywords are required to get on the lists. Many people know this, and that partly complicates our work. That's why we need new technology.\" According to Timo Jäntti, it is now easy for a direct search consultant to find people but separating really good applicants from those who just claim to be good is more difficult. \"We used to look for a needle in a haystack, and it was found when we introduced a bigger magnet.\" he says.\n\n\n\r\nTo know more about our services like leadership coaching, professional hiring, management consulting, reach out to us at \nwww.taplowgroup.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (4107)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Because everyone was stuck in the four walls of their homes, organizations had to get creative and come up with new techniques to keep their employees focused and productive. Work From Home undoubtedly has its advantages but this culture also leads to a quicker burnout due to the work life balance becoming completely distorted. Amidst the pandemic, job roles that require fixed equipment suffered tremendously. For some sectors, WFH culture is rarely an option since they rely on jobs involving machinery, lab equipment, transactions etc.\n\n\n\r\nAs we face the pandemic and try to move past it, vaccination drives have been organized by various organizations to bring back their workforce safely into offices. But we’re not yet completely safe from Covid-19 with the threat of a new wave constantly looming over our heads. Organizations are trying to think out of the box and come up with a mid-way between remote work and working in office. This is how the hybrid model will come into play where employees get to choose the work culture, they feel most comfortable and safe in. Hybrid model provides both, flexibility of working from home while simultaneously stepping in to work based on convenience and necessity.\n\n\n\r\nGoogle was one of the first to jump on the hybrid model bandwagon, allowing employees to be physically present only 3 days a week. Salesforce also followed suit, believing 9-5 workday is a dead concept. Advocates of the hybrid model believe culture doesn’t need 4 walls to thrive. For hybrid model to be effective, organizations need to provide the right infrastructure and have clear cut boundaries. The right software needs to be in place and training needs to be conducted to ensure employees are at their most productive self in this new model.\n\n\n\r\nIf executed properly, hybrid work setup is here to stay. It’s the perfect balance between WFH culture and strict office hours. All in all, organizations need to accept that the future of work is hybrid and re-evaluate what works for them and reform their policies as well as business models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (4017)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

A diverse board will help your organization thrive in this dynamic and ever-changing business landscape. It would understand the demographics of potential clients, their cultural disposition, and embrace opportunities for your organization.\n\n\n\r\nIt is indeed a daunting task to find agile and flexible board members who can navigate the firms in times of uncertainty and lay out the strategies to stay ahead of the competition. This is where our \n board member recruitment consultants \ncome in to assist you. We have decades of experience in this field of board members recruitment, and we have done it for public, private, and non-profit organizations. Our industrial professional recruitment experts have in-depth knowledge about the industry, and they would strategize the right plan, tailored to your business needs.\n\n\n\r\nNow the question is how to diversify the board? Let us take a closer look –\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the gaps\n\r\nBefore you look to diversify your board, you need to identify what’s missing? Do you lack a member who has a good grasp on social media and the PR nuances? Is there a need for a board member who has sound domain knowledge? Once the need gap analysis is completed, we will compose a plan to fulfil the gaps. This is where our process is different from any ordinary recruitment, which is merely an arbitrary process.\n\n\n\n\nEmbrace diversity\n\r\nThe diversity acceptance levels are not the same for everyone. Once the gaps are identified, we need to make sure that every board member realizes them and accepts the fact that they need to increase diversity in the team. Otherwise, it results in clashes, unhealthy group dynamics, ultimately hitting the organization hard. Once the existing board embraces corporate diversity then the rest of the process is a fairly easy task.\n\n\n\n\nReach out to all contacts\n\r\nFor \n board members recruitment\n, we do no use database-driven techniques. It never works! We talk with the present board members and use our connections and in depth research to find the best-suited candidate, not only those that are in the job market. Direct referrals work best in these extremely important positions. You just cannot recruit anyone for your board. It has to be someone who has the experience, someone who is willing to stand in front and guide the head of department executives, so that they can take your organization to its zenith.\n\n\n\n\nInduction process\n\r\nRecruitment ends once the selection is done? This is a myth for us! We ensure a smooth onboarding and induction process for the new employee. Our board governance services firm ensures that the new hire is aligned with the organization’s processes and culture. We activly guide the person for a brief period so that they can quickly perform at their best.\n\n\n\r\nWe have delivered exceptional performance in the past and our\n \n board member recruitment consultants\n \nwill continue to do so in the future. The compliments that we get serve as testimony to our world-class service. Hence, if you are looking to develop a diverse board, then connect with us at the earliest!\n\n\n\r\nAt The Taplow Group we help you source the best-fit for your organization’s \n leadership\n through our \n executive search consultants.\n To know more about our services like leadership coaching, professional hiring, management consulting, reach out to us at \nwww.taplowgroup.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3880)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

The present workforce needs to adapt to these changes by constantly upskilling themselves. Technology has disrupted the business landscape and people need to transform to thrive and earn in the future. But what are the skills that need to be mastered?\nMcKinsey Global Institute lists down 56 foundational skills that will lead to higher proficiency and benefit people across the globe. Foundational skills are defined as those that help an individual to add value beyond automation and technology and constantly adapt to the changes around him. These skills have been classified into four categories – Cognitive, Interpersonal, \n Self-Leadership\n, and Digital. While assessing the present proficiencies across these categories, it was found that the lowest was for the digital bucket specific to software use and understanding digital systems, clearly highlighting the lack of digital literacy.\nThe proficiencies under the cognitive and \n digital\n categories are directly related to the education levels while for the remaining categories there exits the lowest correlation between education and proficiency levels. It has also been observed that high proficiency is related to higher employability, income, and job satisfaction. Self-confidence and organization awareness are top proficiencies contributing to higher incomes.\nThe purpose of identifying these skills is to refine the education systems, giving more scope for technology and AI-related courses, abilities to develop these proficiencies, and making young people future read and sustainable for the future. The need of the hour is a high-quality education at an affordable range!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3704)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

The pandemic has brought to the limelight the importance of technology maturity and having a robust digital strategy to survive and stay ahead in the game. This requires skilled assets to navigate the business transformation and hence organizations are on a hiring spree. Cloud, data analytics, cybersecurity, enterprise platforms are some of \n the digital and technology services\n witnessing a huge demand for skilled talents.\nThe demand for consultants and lawyers is at its highest peak post-pandemic. Consulting firms like Deloitte, KPMG, EY, and PwC have increased hiring by 20% as compared to pre-pandemic figures. Combining the figures of BDO, BCG, Grant Thornton, and McKinsey, we see more than 20,000 professionals being employed in the last 6-8 months alone. Additionally, these firms plan to add more than 20,000 professionals in the coming few months.\nMany leaders are elated to notice the positive movement in their hiring trajectory. They largely credit it to the optimistic economic environment, clients’ focus on value creation, and a buoyant capital and transactions market. Alongside consultants, lawyers are seeing an uptick in the recruitment process, especially focused on areas like strategic M&As, digital investments, consolidation of assets, and company restructuring. More than 250 professionals were hired by top law firms in the last 5 months.\nThe immense talent shortage has resulted in a talent war which is translated into an average 20% hike to more than 100% in certain cases.

The new variants of the Covid virus – dubbed Delta and Lambda – are still relatively unknown in terms of transmissibility and the effectiveness of the current vaccines.\n\n\n\r\nBoth governments are struggling with the need to keep economies open while protecting vulnerable populations. Lower income workers have been most impacted by return-to-work anomalies on a state-by-state basis as well as in urban areas of Canada resulting in many not returning to work as childcare and other dependents cared for at home such as elderly are subsidized for non-workers and if lower income individuals return to work, they jeopardize or lose these various subsidies.\n\n\n\r\nIn the US, bare knuckle politics with little concern for the victims is going on in many states and at a national level. Canadian reports seem to reveal higher infection and vaccination rates in urban areas but still appear less contentious than in the Unites States. Texas and Florida were reported by the US CDC as having as almost 3x the number of cases as a percentage of population compared to states taking care to follow the advice of most medical professionals regarding vaccination and masking.\n\n\n\n\nUS health authorities are generally advising that un-vaccinated populations can cause the spread of the pernicious virus variants\n even if the individuals do not have symptoms. Now, US health authorities are advising that a recent uptick in vaccinations is resulting in about 50%+ of all eligible for the vaccine are fully vaccinated. Although the vaccination numbers are improving so are the number of cases requiring treatment. Canadian authorities are reporting approximately 60% of the eligible population are vaccinated as of August 4th.\n\n\n\r\nUS vaccination rates are lowest in southern states, which are experiencing 3x more cases than US averages, as well as in primarily agricultural states in the mid-western regions. Canadian vaccination rates are lowest in the very rural and sparsely populated northern provinces.\n\n\nBRAZIL\n\n\n2021 Brazilian GDP\n - According to the Central Bank of Brazil - Focus Survey Report, the Brazilian financial market just raised the 2021 GDP growth rate forecast from 5.18% to 5.26%. For 2022, GDP growth rate was adjusted from 2.10% down to 2.09%. In 2022 Brazil will have presidential and state governors’ elections.\n\n\n\n\nServices, the most affected economic sector by the pandemic,\n has accumulated a semestral increase in Volume of 9.5%; June increase in Services Volume achieved 1.7% as compared to the previous month, says IPEA, the “Institute for Applied Economic Research”, a governmental institution. This figure accumulates a 4.4% increase for the second quarter of 2021 and a 21.1% for the last 12 months ended in June 2021.\n\n\n\n\nCurrent performance of total Volume of Services exceeded 2.4% over pre-pandemic month of February 2020\n, attaining its highest level since 2016.Compared to its all-times historical record of Volume of Services in 2014, current figures remain 9.1% below.\n\n\n\n\nOther positive results encompassing economic sectors calls for a strong recovery of 21.2% increase in Air Service\n in June 2021, against May 2021, according to IBGE. Information & Communications sector rose 2.5% in June 2021, against previous month and Transportation & Services sector achieved an increase of 8.1% - June 2021 versus February 2020 (pre-pandemic month). In terms of 2021 Semestral Recoveries – Jan 2021 – June 30, 2021, the following sectors performed as follows: Industrial: 12.9%; Services: 9.5%; Commercial: 6.7%, says IBGE.\n\n\n\n\nSoybean is the “Brazilian golden grain”\n – It is the main product of country grain crop and one of the most important export items. Today, Brazil is the world’s largest producer and exporter of Soybean, a grain originated from Asia in the 19th century. Known as one of the most versatile grain, Soybean integrates animal food, produces cooking/comestible oil, is an aggregate of biodiesel, and is fully present in the vegetarian cuisine, as vegetable meat.\n\n\n\r\nIn 2019, Soybean produced in Brazil achieved an all-time record of 114 million tons. Embrapa, the governmental R&D institution for agricultural products, has developed and implemented highly technological solutions to adapt the grain and the soil, as well as special and versatile planting and harvesting equipment to achieve such an inedited productivity of the Brazilian Soybean Project!\n\n\n\n\nBrazilian Labor Market begins to show more dynamism reverberating the recovery of the activity level\n, according to IPEA. Although the May 2021 unemployment rate of 14.3% remains 1.5% above the same period in 2020, the stability of the unemployment rate is quite a reality. The situation of the labor market has improved and has brought an expansion of the employed population, which current force is 88.2 million people. In May 2019, the employed population was 93.5 million.\n\n\n\r\nIn the “formal” (registered) employment pool of the private sector, reports indicate a growth of 2.9 million jobs for a 12-month period ended in June 2021. Major employment sectors were Commerce, Industry, Administrative Services and Civil Construction.\n\n\n Tacito Bocaiuva, E: \ntbocaiuva@taplowgroup.com\n\n\nMEXICO\n\n\nMexico is a strategic player in the old NAFTA\n – North American Free Trade Agreement, in force since 1994, which in fact expired in August 2018 and was replaced by a new and similar Agreement under the Trump Administration and with the Canadians blessing as well. It is in continuity of a Regional trilateral treaty, jointly administered by Washington, DC, Ottawa\n\r\nand Mexico City, with the purpose of promoting the development of the regional economy. It eliminates customs barriers to exchange merchandise and services amongst the three countries, under a free, competitive business environment, fostering increase in investments, materializing of mutually interested business opportunities, under an adequate protection of intellectual properties. In addition, the country has an active participation in other commercial blocks, such as: OMC, APEC, OCDE.\n\n\n\n\nMexico has a well-diversified economy, comprising highly technological industries\n, oil production surpluses for exports, agribusiness (7th largest agricultural force world-wide), mining and manufacturing sectors. Key export items includes oil, vehicles and auto parts, computers, textiles; USA is the main destination of Mexican export portfolio, with 80% of total export force. Oil, alone, PEMEX, represents 1/3 of total Mexican exports. Other typical export products are Beer – 2nd largest exporter, coffee, sugar, corn, orange, avocado, and lemon. Population is nearing 126 million, 11th place world-wide; the average age is 29 years old.\n\n\n\n\nMexican pre-Covid GDP was US$ 1,249 trillion and GDP per capita achieved US$ 9.000.\n Mexico is the 2nd largest economy in Latin America, only before Brazil’s, and ranks amongst the 15 largest world-wide economies.\n\r\nAccording to the IMF – World Economic Outlook Database - April 2021, last years of pre-covid GDP annual variance indicated a 2.2% growth in 2018, -0.1% in 2019 and a -8.2% in 2020. There has been a recovery in 2021, showing a GDP increase of 5.0%.\n\n\n\n\nDespite of the adverse impact of Covid-19 in the Mexican economy overall, the agricultural sector showed a small growth.\n Current inflation rates are: 3.5%, per - 2021 forecast; in previous years: 3.4% in 2020 and 3.6% in 2019. Unemployment rates have been low and steady, running at 3.6% in 2021, 4.4% in 2020, impacted by the pandemic,\n\r\nand 3.5% in 2019. Mexican Labor Force employs 26.1% in the Industrial sector, which responds for 30.88% of GDP; the Services sector, responsible for 59.87% of GDP employs 61.37% of the active working force.\n\n\n\r\nAccording to the IMF’s “Policy Responses to Covid-19”, via its “Policy Tracker “ of July 2nd, 2021, besides higher health expenditure of 0.4% of GDP, Mexico’s fiscal response to the Covid-19 impact in the economy included the following measures in 2020: 1) Frontloading payments of the old-age and disability pensions by 8 months; 2) Accelerating procurement processes and VAT refunds; 3) lending to firms and workers in both formal and informal sectors:\n\r\n4) providing liquidity support and guarantees by development banks (257.1 billion pesos).\n\n\n Tacito Bocaiuva , Americas, Regional Director E: \ntbocaiuva@taplowgroup.com\n\n\nUSA\n\n\nEconomic Growth\n: Not all growth is equal in terms of the benefits to the national, regional, and global economies. Inflation skews the assessment of GDP changes and inflationary estimates. Year over year, inflation has been reported through June 30th has been reported as 5.4% in the US and just over 3% as reported by Bank of Canada in Canada.\n\n\n\r\nProjections for both countries are relatively similar with government agencies and investment managers/investment banks forecasting between slight over 3% for the remainder of the 2021-2022 year. Various analysts are skeptical and are assuming higher rates of inflation as the certainty of controlling the Pandemic is not clear now.\n\n\n\n\nImportantly, some commentators believe that workforce stability will be negatively influenced by a shortage of workers\n willing to return to traditional workplaces and workers leaving as there is no apparent shortage or WFH (work from home) for technology and scientific knowledge workers. Taplow is gathering data for a further report on the projected prevalence of permanent and other WFH arrangements in the various major sectors of the North American economies.\n\n\n\n\nSome US commentators are particularly watching the activities of our central bank\n – known in the US as The Federal Reserve Bank. We are in the 6th consecutive quarter of accommodative policies related to US currency. Economists and journalists note that the bank has been very careful to not let a fear of any contraction of the money supply or increase in borrowing cost impair the economy. Some critics are concerned that if the economy continues to accelerate(grow) at current rates, we may have inflation which would reduce the value of the US Dollar. Others believe that the support by “The Fed” has already depreciated the value of the US Dollar. There is a lack of consistency in opinions which results in our hesitancy to report a direction.\n\n\n\n\nEmployment Issues: There are 3 major issues which are challenging most employers.\n\n\n\r\n1. Work from home vs from a fixed location – major employers and pundits alike are seemingly evenly divided on which strategy will be likely. Our sense is that fixed location with safeguards (frequent screening, mandatory vaccinations, separation of workspaces to assure adequate distancing) is likely to be the norm as knowing your colleagues is important for work requiring collaboration on an hour-by-hour basis.\n\n\n\r\n2. Recruiting and retaining employees while striving for enhanced diversity. Costs for direct wages, benefits and training are likely issues. We already note the drop off of long service highly skilled/educated employees. Productivity is yet to be well measured under either or hybrid scenarios. Airlines appear to be particularly impacted by early retirement by senior professionals.\n\n\n\r\n3. Some employees inherently have to be out in the field to accomplish their jobs. Assuring customer/client and employee health and safety will require costly and timely interventions creating new roles in many businesses. Occupational Health and Safety will never be the same.\n\n\n\n\nSustainability and Macro Issues:\n\r\nPeople, Commitment and Persistence: most of our executives understand the reality that our workforce and our approach to doing business will require significant rethinking. Our P&L is not our only focus.\n\n\n\r\nWe are graded by employees, customers, competitors, and government on our ability to reduce emissions and the consumption of raw materials which contribute to global warming/climate change.\n\n\n\n\nWe are also graded on our approach to employment:\n\r\n1. While we have to protect our employees and customers we are also realizing – in most quarters- that this is a unique opportunity to hire and develop workers for re-engineered roles in many enterprises. Training less well-educated employees for technical roles not requiring the advanced study of science, engineering, or finance. It will require rethinking required credentials but if well done, can be a catalyst for expanding our talent pool. As well, both entry level and experienced workers can be re-purposed to more meaningful and potentially higher-level roles.\n\n\n\r\n2. Our ideas about employment will also change. In professional services many firms are already allowing their employees to create their own LLC or LLP and contract with the firm they “work” for.\n\n\n\n\nThe Impact of International Relations:\n\r\nChina is critical to the manufacturing processes of the entire global economy. Data on the prevalence of Chinese manufactured “chips” and numerous other components is too complex to analyze for this report however, virtually every North American manufacturing business has component parts that are to some extent manufactured in China and shipped to North America. Shortages have caused material delays and materially driven up prices for vehicles across the entire spectrum from passenger cars to trucks and consumer appliances from mobile phones to refrigerators.\n\n\n\n\nOpportunities and limitations:\n\r\nFrom the employee perspective, an undervalued employee is in a good position to make a move which may -from time to time – be very disruptive in the enterprise he or she is departing. However, every departure is an opportunity to reconsider the role and the requirements. We have seen numerous situations over the last 18 months when the current incumbent couldn’t do the job at the level really required – the replacement, while perhaps expensive, can be counted on to enhance the breadth of the function.\n\n\n\r\nSimilarly, the changes in the economy and the needs of an enterprise might well require the acquisition of an employee with quite different skills. The strain on even the most successful organizations and their leaders have sharpened the focus on what we need vs. what we had.\n\n\n Steve Schrenzel, Managing Partner, USA E: \nsschrenzel@taplowes.com\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2911)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Studies have proven that companies with a higher rate of gender equality are far more successful. But these research numbers don’t necessarily translate into actual female leadership. On the contrary, female leadership has only increased 2% to 4% in the last 2 years, even though the awareness around the subject has been several folds more. This is where having a good \n executive search consultant\n comes into play, to not just make your organization look woke, but make it actually woke by seeking promising yet diverse candidates and vetting them thoroughly.\nThe pandemic was a huge eye opener in terms of gender inequality. It highlighted several other roles that women play at home simultaneously while fulfilling their work duties. Women aren’t just work wives, but actual wives too and it’s heartbreaking to witness how many organizations fail to realize that. And even fewer stepped in to help. Rather than being supportive, some organizations actually let go of significant number of female employees because of the challenges they faced with work life balance.\nOrganizations need to rely heavily on gender equality rather than having a laid-back approach or being satisfied with the ‘Doing the best we can’ approach. Having a higher female employee ratio not only improves performance numbers and translates into higher profit margins but also leads to greater overall employee satisfaction. Women leaders are far more empathetic which makes them more capable of handling obstacles and ensuring employee loyalty. They also have a higher EQ, which is one of the key skills of being ‘a league apart’ leader.\nRight now, is as good a time as any to invest in higher female employment to build a productive, efficient, and diverse workplace of the future. Our \n executive search services\n can help you achieve your goal of being a diverse employer. Today, organizations need to aggressively invest in workplace diversity if they want to stay relevant in the coming years. Good PR strategies and CSR initiatives no longer cut it. Organizations need to work upon, improve and upgrade their executive board. After all, there is no better PR than having a board of directors full of capable and diverse individuals that will lead your organization to better growth and newer heights. Your search for the perfect executive ends with our executive search consultants who will leave no stone unturned to find the best candidate i.e., an amalgamation of all your needs.\nOur \n executive recruitment consultants\n will ensure that they dig deep into the talent pool to find the ideal candidate. Your employees, irrespective of their gender, need to feel at home in your organization for them to be at their productive best. Therefore, it’s important to invest in a good executive search management consultancy that can help you amend your workplace policies and build a positive culture to ensure it is attractive enough for diverse candidates and more accommodating to females.\nWe are committed to finding the best fit for your organization. It is essential to hire the best talent for each executive position to pave the way for the phenomenal growth of your organization. If you are looking to fill executive positions, then look no further than our world-class results-driven \n executive search services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (4313)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

According to the law of conservation of energy, energy can neither be created nor be destroyed. Hence, whatever energy you put into the universe is what you receive. This is why it’s essential to have a positive spin on everything. \nIn our day-to-day life, we often exaggerate and use absolutes which are extremely unhealthy. Alongside steering away from this habit, one should also stop dwelling on negative thoughts. The moment there is a negative idea in your head, stall it or counter it with a positive one. \nOne should live life constantly looking towards the positive and bright side of it instead of focusing on the negative. Accentuating your strengths and assets will help you be far more productive than ranting about your supposed flaws. No one is perfect and everyone makes mistakes. Contrary to popular belief, blowing it is a great learning technique. You might not have achieved your goal but now you know what not to do, which is as valuable a lesson as any. \nA lot of people feel like a failure because of their own unrealistic expectations. It’s a good thing to aspire but don’t forget to be realistic too. Encourage yourself to be the best version of yourself every day, and on days you don’t feel like it, don’t be guilty. There were days even Barack Obama failed but instead of beating himself up, he just got up and tried again. You’re your best critique, so encourage yourself and don’t forget to reward yourself. Implementing such thought processes will take you a long way in achieving your goals and being the person, you truly aspire to be! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3210)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

The outlook for investment has improved and household and business balance sheets are generally in good shape. National income is also being supported by the high prices for commodity exports. Domestic financial conditions are very supportive, and the exchange rate has depreciated a little recently. The labour market has continued to recover faster than expected.\n\n\nThe unemployment rate declined further to 5.1 per cent in May\n and more Australians have jobs than before the pandemic. There has also been a welcome decline in underemployment and labour force participation is around record highs. Job vacancies are high, and more firms are reporting shortages of labour, particularly in areas affected by the closure of Australia's international borders.\n\n\nDespite the strong recovery in jobs and reports of labour shortages, inflation and wage outcomes remain subdued. The bond purchase program is playing an important role in supporting the Australian economy.

The stock market is also welcome this change.\n\n\nBeijing imposed strict data security measures for the overseas listing companies from China. Didi, the recently listing company in US has been punished for the invasion personal information. The APP is prohibited to be downloaded during the investigation. Beijing is\n\n\nbecoming very serious about the personal information protection and county’s data security and impose the strict measures.\n\n\nChina’s manufacturing PMI and new export orders slightly declined in June and could rebound in July.\n China’s official manufacturing PMI declined to 50.9 in June from 51.0 in May, slightly above market expectations. The new export orders continued to edge down to 48.1 in June, partly caused by congestion at some South China ports. Due to the resurgence of Covid-19 in Guangdong and related tightening in social distancing rules, the official non-manufacturing PMI fell to a weaker-than-expected 53.5 in June.\n\n\nThanks to the release of pent-up demand following the containment of the latest wave\n of Covid-19, the recovery of some South China ports is expected. It is projected that PMI were solid in Q2 and could rebound slightly in July.\n\n\nChina current account has surged and would not last forever.\n Thanks to its successful containment of Covid-19, massive policy stimulus in the developed economies China’s current account (CA) surplus has surged in the past year, foreign exchange deposits have risen significantly and RMB has appreciated as well.

Earlier, Moody's had projected India to clock a 9.3 per cent growth in the current fiscal ending March 2022, but a severe second COVID wave has increased risks to India's credit profile and rated entities. Mobility and economic activity will likely accelerate in the second half of the year as the pace of vaccinations pick up. The government has announced a strategy to centralise vaccine procurement in order to boost vaccinations, which if successful, will support the economic recovery.\n\n\nRatings agency ICRA maintained its growth forecast for two-wheeler sales at 12-14% for the ongoing fiscal\n, despite the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic hitting non-metro and hinterlands that dampened rural consumer sentiments. A low base, healthy rural cash flows, and continued preference for personal mobility would support two-wheeler demand in the festive season, ICRA said in a statement. Expectations of a healthy agricultural production, timely arrival of the monsoons, a hike in minimum support prices for crops and other income support schemes by the government are likely to help revive rural demand sentiments and support the two-wheeler offtake in the festive season.\n\n\nGerman consumer electronics brand Blaupunkt is re-entering the Indian market\n through an exclusive licensing agreement with home-grown contract manufacturer Super Plastronics. As per the licensing contract, Blaupunkt’ s manufacturing, branding, designing, packaging, and retailing supply chain will be handled by Super Plastronics. The products will be available to consumers on the e-commerce platform. Super Plastronics will invest more than $30 Million in Blaupunkt in the next three years in technology & innovation.\n\n\nWith Global Steel Player ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel, India’s play in the steel\n market is set to get bigger. The company is busy making plans that would increase its capacity by five million tonnes in the next three years while laying building blocks for the phase after.\n\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer for ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India (AM/NS India) said the ground-breaking for the expansion to 14 million tonnes was expected this year. In the next phase, they will take it up to 18 million tonnes. The two phases of expansion are expected to cost more than $7000 Million\n\n\nContact: Sangeeta Sabharwal, Managing Partner, India E: \nsangeeta.sabharwal@taplowgroupindia.com\n\n\nNew Zealand\n\n\nNew Zealand is well on the way to economic recovery after the damage wrought by COVID-19\n. Going into the crisis, every economic forecaster was expecting a large and drawn-out recession, with the possibility of deflation, and a 10% unemployment rate, and an economy that would struggle to get back to pre-COVID levels of output. What has occurred is that GDP has recovered spectacularly, and recent labour market data showed that New Zealand’s labour market is far closer to full employment than anyone could have hoped for.\n\n\nUnlike some of our trading partners, such as the US and Australia, New Zealand did not see a large drop in employment\n as a result of lockdown in second quarter 2020. Some people did unfortunately lose their jobs, but in aggregate, the damage was limited. That made it much easier to switch the economy back on after lockdown, and we have seen employment in New Zealand actually increase above pre-COVID levels in recent months.\n\n\nFor better or worse, the housing market has been the key driver of the economic rebound from lockdown\n. Demand for housing is still well ahead of supply and this has given the construction sector an almost overwhelmingly large pipeline of work. The crisis has had an impact on the supply side of the economy. The sectors that propelled New Zealand’s economic recovery, in particular construction, are running into serious capacity constraints. One reason is the disruption to global supply chains caused by COVID-19. Firms and tradespeople in New Zealand are finding it harder to import the goods they need, leading to cost overruns and delays.\n\n\nThe labour market is very tight, and firms are struggling to find workers they need\n. Many of the jobs lost due to COVID were face-to-face industries like tourism and hospitality. With the borders closed, the latter industry is struggling to find the workers they need to be able to provide the service necessary. Some have elected to reduce hours of opening or in one case close down their restaurants for a period of two weeks to be able to give their workforce a break from the demands of being over worked as a result of the shortage. A closed border will mean labour supply is fairly unresponsive, so it is likely that we will see stronger wage growth rather than strong employment growth, as firm poach off each other. It is expected that New Zealand’s labour supply will get a small bump once borders reopen and net migration starts to lift.\n\n\nIn New Zealand, it appears that foregone international holiday spending has been finding its way into house renovations, spas, cars and boats\n. Supply chain issues means that there can be a wait for these goods e.g., up to 3-4 months wait for a new car due to the need to import these into New Zealand.\n\n\nNew Zealand now has a travel bubble with both Australia and the Cook Islands\n, though the former has had a wobbly period since being introduced with a number of temporary border closures being imposed by the New Zealand government with Australia states as a result of community outbreaks, especially since the Delta variant has become more and more widespread. The deteriorating situation in New South Wales (in particular Sydney) an latterly Victoria could see the travel bubble with these states closed for some time.\n\n\nWhile New Zealand led the world on its initial response to COVID-19, we are lagging behind on vaccinations\n. As of writing, only 10% of the population has been fully vaccinated. In New Zealand the Pfizer/BioNTech is being used. There are back-up vaccines available should these be needed. A major surge in vaccinations has been announced by the New Zealand government which should see this rate increase significantly over the coming months. Source– ANZ Bank Quarterly Economic Outlook.\n\n\nContact: Graeme Sandri, Managing Partner, New Zealand, E: \ngraeme@swr.nz\n\n\nSingapore\n\n\nSingapore's economy contracted in the second quarter after battling new outbreaks of COVID-19\n, but economists expect it to get back on track quickly as global growth picks up and vaccination rates rise. The city state's economy still showed the best growth in more than a decade on a year-on-year basis, as many economies have done because of last year's coronavirus-induced slump.\n\n\nAnalysts have upgraded Singapore's trade outlook for 2021\n, in the wake of the better-than-expected export performance in the first half. External demand is tipped to stay strong in the next six months, even though Covid-19 outbreaks in key markets cast a pall over the forecast.\n\n\nThe manufacturing sector grew by 18.5% year on year\n, helped by robust global demand for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment. The construction sector expanded 98.8% compared with a year earlier when most construction activities stopped due to the lockdown.\n\n\nAcross the service sectors - the wholesale and retail trade, and transportation and storage sectors grew by 9.3 per cent in the second quarter of this year\n, reversing the 1.7 per cent contraction in the previous quarter. The remaining group of service sectors - accommodation and food service, real estate, administrative and support service, and other service sectors - expanded by 13.4 per cent.\n\n\nContact: Lee Fang Xing, Managing Partner, Singapore, E: \nlfang@taplowgroup.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (8877)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Your employees are your organization’s backbone. Without the right people for the job, even the greatest product or idea will not translate into success. This is where \n Global Executive Search Services\n come into play. They help you find the right people for the job and ensure you build together something meaningful & phenomenal. Some of the key factors you should keep in mind while conducting Global Executive Search are: -\n\n\n\n\nHighlight Your Company’s Code of Conduct \n\r\nPeople who work for you need to relate to your code of conduct and their value system should be in line with it. It is not just about impressing customers or having a few good annual ratings. Your employees are your representatives in the real world and should stand for the same things you do. Once you are clear about the larger picture, have a fair idea of the work environment you’re aiming for, core values of the organization, you can go ahead and hire \n global management consultants\n to help you find people who are in line with your vision.\n\n\n\n\nReview Behavioral Aspects\n\r\nSure, degrees and experience play a key role in the interviewing process, but one should never underestimate attitude and their behavior. It is essential to have a workforce that has the right skillset as well as mindset to help you overcome all possible obstacles and challenges.\n\n\nWhile conducting Global Executive Search\n, one should always seek answers to relevant questions like - Where do they see themselves in 5 years? What are their short term as well as long term goals? What has been their biggest risk so far? Answers to such thought-provoking questions will help you determine if the person is right for the job.\n\n\n\n\nHave Specific Requirements\n\r\nWhen you are conducting interviews and building your workforce, you should be crystal clear on the job description. One should carefully develop roles and know their importance towards the company’s growth. Having well thought out job specifications and descriptions helps you focus your search and find the right person for the job more efficiently.\n\n\n\n\nDon’t Delay\n\r\nFinding the perfect candidate can be an excruciatingly hard task and long process. So, once you are sure they are right for the job, act quickly, don’t drag your feet. Chances are, they probably have enticing offers from other organizations too. All the time you spend contemplating and pondering could potentially cost you your perfect asset.\n\n\n\r\nBusinesses, be it big or small, are largely dependent on people behind the products or services being offered. Running a successful organization is not a one man’s job, no matter how great you might be in all the roles. Hence, it is imperative to hire people who are as passionate about your business as you and serve as its ride or die. The employees’ passion, enthusiasm, and loyalty is what drives an organization to success. Forming the right team can be a taxing process. So, take as much time as you need, put in the work, and build yourself a workforce comprising of gifted, dedicated individuals who will help you construct the perfect organization.\n\n\n\r\nOur\n global executive search consultants\n will ensure that the right positions are filled by the right leaders. We are committed to finding the best fit for your organization. It is essential to hire the best talent for each executive position to pave the way for the phenomenal growth of your organization.

    "content": "Human Capital Development: Why Organizations Must Pay Attention\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nFriday, July 9, 2021\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nAn organization is only as good as the people working for it. Human Capital, as the term suggests, is the monetary value that the employees of an organization bring to the organization. Employees from the leadership to the junior-most post, together form the backbone of the company. However, what most companies fail to focus on is the investment in their \n human capital\n. Sure, having decent packages for them is a good start and an honorable way of making them feel valued, but where do you go from there? This is where human capital investment comes into play. Here are some sure shot ways to effectively invest in your people and in turn gain the most benefits are:\n\n\n\n\n1. Effective Employee Engagement \n\r\nWhenever employees are more engaged, they tend to work better, both as an individual as well as a team. This also helps hike up their loyalty to the organization. One of the most successful ways to increase employee engagement is via advancing their careers and looking into their growth graph, helping them be the best version of themselves.\n\n\n\n\n2. Higher Retention Rates \n\r\nEmployee engagement and high retention rates go hand in hand. A career-driven employee will always value special care and attention to their career advancement opportunities to a heftier package. People who feel that they are constantly growing and educating themselves while enhancing their skillset will be less likely to look for a new job. If they feel valued and are given ample incentives as well as promotions, they would not explore growth opportunities elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n3. Healthy Work Environment \n\r\nNothing is more significant than a healthy working environment. Environment, be it at home, in school or your workplace, essentially defines your level of productivity. It is what cushions the blows of failure, makes your career highs feel higher, motivates you to do better and boosts your confidence. A blooming work environment is a perfect balance between healthy competition and celebrating your co-workers’ successes. Company culture is defined by employee satisfaction, engagement, and communication. A good mix of all three leads to amazing \n human capital development. \n\n\n\n\n4. Efficient Communication \n\r\nConversation births new and fresh ideas as well as helps resolve the most complicated issues. \n Human capital\n development is incomplete without effective communication. There should be ample communication between various levels of hierarchy and everyone’s doors as well as ears should be open for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n5. Hiring the right people for the job \n\r\nRetaining your employees is hard but finding employees worth retaining is even harder. It is not just about professional degrees and fancy talent, it is more about who fits your company culture and will be comfortable in the company culture. Finding the right people through \nhuman capital search services\n is key. While hiring new people, it is critical to make them feel comfortable and assure them that they will be nurtured while putting their skill-set to the best use.\n\n\n\r\nUnless organizations strengthen their human capital, they cannot achieve sustained, growth. It is extremely important to invest in human capital development on a regular and timely basis to ensure your organization as well as your human capital reaches new heights and is at the top of their game always!\n\n\n\r\nAt The Taplow Group we have extensive experience in designing, delivering, and benchmarking Human capital projects in addition to human capital services, to ensure our clients fully realize their employees’ full potential.

You could have the most unique product, robust finances, the best brains at your disposal, but if your leader does not know how to successfully put all those resources to the best use, it is not going to a successful venture. Leaders are not just responsible for the top-line and bottom-line figures, they also play a key role in boosting employee morale, ensuring a healthy working environment, delegating duties to ensure optimum efficiency and are the face of your organization. Your leader should say everything you want to be said about your organization.\n\n\n\r\nDue to the enormity of the role, leadership training becomes extremely critical. After all, good leaders aren’t born, they’re created. Leadership coaching focuses on the skill development of your current as well as your future leaders. It revolves around teaching all the things that are not focused on even in the best of B schools around the globe and can be learnt only on the job. \n Leadership development \n coaching ensures that your business leaders are ready for any challenge, no matter how absurd or rare, that might come their way.\n\n\n\r\nHowever, just understanding the importance of leadership development coaching isn’t enough, one also needs to be well aware about how to pick the program that’s just right for you. One should always do their research and opt for training techniques that feel tailor made for your needs. There are various types of \n leadership training programs\n available in the market today, so that gives you a galore to choose from. Some of the common ones are:\n\n\n\n\n1. Professional Training Seminars\n\r\nProfessional training seminars focus exclusively on leadership courses and have activities that help participants sharpen their leadership skills via effective group activities. They always have a professional present, usually from \n a leadership development management services firm,\n to cater to your needs and answer all your queries.\n\n\n\n\n2. Leadership Conferences and Workshops \n\r\nLeadership Conferences have leaders from different organizations coming together and sharing their experiences, day to day challenges they face, and brainstorm ideas to become a better and more effective leader. Such conferences and workshops are also a phenomenal networking opportunity as you get to meet like-minded people who’re in similar roles and learn from them. Leadership workshops, on the other hand, are more focused on a specific topic which helps participants clarify their concepts, revisit their ideologies, and gives them the opportunity to work on a particular skill rather than their entire skillset all at once.\n\n\n\n\n3. Executive Leadership Training\n\r\nExecutive leadership training is for higher echelons of any organization. It teaches leaders how to make future leaders. \n Executive leadership coaching\n is also to refresh existing leaders’ skills and make them more up to date with the current market. This also helps in giving them newer, more unique ideas for guiding your organization towards new heights.\n\n\n\n\n4. Online Leadership Training\n\r\nThis format of \n leadership development coaching\n has become especially relevant and popular in the current scenario, given as we are all stuck at home and looking for new ways to enhance our skillset. The added benefit of online leadership development training is that you can do it at your own time, at your own pace. \n\n\n\r\nDo you wish to accelerate the development of your leaders?

To get the right consumer pulse and race ahead of your competition you not only need the best strategies but also the best brains to devise them. In short, you need the \n best global consumer sector executive search services.\nA trend that has become prominent in the last 5 years is the idea of women climbing the ladder and earning positions of leadership within the consumer goods industry. Historically, we have always seen an under-representation of women across the business world. But this is a sector where women can thrive a lot when given an opportunity to lead the organization.\nMost of the companies in the consumer sector are now having gender balance and diversity as a top agenda for the leadership. Coca-Cola’s GM for Central Europe says that gender diversity is crucial for success and forms a key element of the core values of the organization. Similar sentiments can be seen across the industry.\nNow comes the bigger challenge! How will you search and recruit the best persons for the job? It is indeed a daunting job to find suitable talent for the open positions and keeping in mind gender diversity makes it even more challenging.

They have in-depth knowledge about the market conditions, their challenges, and opportunities. What that means is – you get tailor-made recruitment strategies completely aligned as per your vision, organizational culture, and business processes.\nOur approach is completely different from the traditional recruitment agencies. We do not depend only on the database and follow a single solution for all assignments. The experts have a wide network of contacts across the globe, and they function primarily on personal contacts and references. We take care of the entire process from identifying the right candidate, to interview and onboarding. All our selected candidates have delivered exceptional values year after year and no doubt, leading consumer goods firm wants to partner with us for our\n global consumer sector executive search services.\nThe future will see a lot more representation of women in senior leadership and c-suite positions. This means you need the best recruiters to headhunt and find the perfect match for your position. With senior leadership, you cannot afford to make any mistake. It would be costly and can mar your business reputation for good. Hence, you must select the best global executive search consultant firm and stay ahead in the competition. Select the right leadership for your organization today and ensure the perfect gender balance and parity within your workforce. If you have agile, adaptive, ad visionary leaders then you will always emerge as the winner in every game.\nAt The Taplow Group we not only help you source the best-fit for your organization’s leadership through our\n executive search consultants\n but also train and develop them to hone their skills.

    "content": "How The Pandemic Has Changed Not Just How We Work But Also How We Hire\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nFriday, June 25, 2021\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExecutive search services have seen changes and shifts all along but never ever has there been such a drastic transformation as it has witnessed in the last year and a half. Executive search is an industry that thrives on meeting people, both the clients and the candidates, and assesses people based on these face-to-face interviews. With Covid-19 reducing the face time to an absolute zero, \nexecutive search consultants\n have transformed the way they work and hire.\nBlending remote work environment with virtual tools has resulted in faster turnaround for search processes.\nOver the last year, \nexecutive recruitment consultants\n have hired C-suite executives whom they have never met. They say that it is amazing how they haven’t met either the candidates or the client and the entire process just got over. One thing is sure, the time to hire has drastically reduced from months to weeks in the virtual process. At the same time, remote working has not only widened the candidate pool but also has made it possible for the candidates to interact with many organizations as well.\nHowever, at the same time some organizations, as well as candidates, find the virtual interaction too much of a barrier. After all, video interviews cannot replace the understanding and insights that both clients and candidates can derive from face-to-face interviews.\nAnother area where a lot of emphases is being given is the area of interpersonal skills. Since there are no lunch room or water cooler conversations, new executives are expected to reach out to as many people as possible, connect with the team on an empathetic level and grab the team dynamics at the earliest. Hence as \nexecutive search consultants\n, the task is to hire folks who are agile and adaptive, people who can align with the team easily and deliver results promptly.\nWhen one looks from the viewpoint of a candidate what matters the most, is the perception about the organization and it is developed from the presence in social media and digital platforms. The press generated about a company has a huge impact on the decision of the candidates. Post pandemic candidates are deeply assessing the social and environmental responsibility of the company before making a big decision.\nExecutives want short-term feedback and clear, measurable metrics. With office politics getting hidden behind remote work, transparency is now the new normal. Every organization is expected to be meritocratic and executives demand clear feedback. \nExecutive search consultants\n are looking for fast-paced and clear-sighted people. There is no room for politics or ambiguity in the workplace anymore.\nThe pandemic has taught the world how to be agile and adapt to new circumstances promptly. The executive search industry is now grooming people to become more aligned to the remote working model. The virtual workplace model has not only changed how people are recruited, but also the models of the coaching, mentoring, and training programs. The entire \nexecutive search services\n are now re-aligned to manage the nuances of the virtual workplace.\nOur executive search consultants will ensure that the right positions are filled by the right leaders. We are committed to finding the best fit for your organization. It is essential to hire the best talent for each executive position to pave the way for the phenomenal growth of your organization. If you are looking to fill executive positions, then look no further than our world-class results-driven \nexecutive search services\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (4433)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Macroeconomic policies will in many countries entail some difficult choices.\n\n\nSouth Africa\n\n\nSouth Africa's current account balance widened to 5% of GDP for the first quarter of the year, up from the 3.7% recorded previously, data from the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) shows.\n\n\nThe current account balance is considered an indicator of an economy's health. It is the difference between credits - incomes and receipts - and debits - imports and payments. In monetary terms the surplus is R267 billion, the second largest recorded. The largest monetary surplus recorded was in the third quarter, at R297.5 billion.\n\n\nThe largest surplus in monetary terms was recorded in the third quarter of 2020, equal to 5.9% of GDP,\" the SARB said. At the time trade surpluses rebounded as Covid-19 related lockdown restrictions started easing globally,\n\n\nThe SARB said that the first quarter current account surplus is largely attributed to a continuation of a good export performance, on the back of high commodity prices, coupled with a recovery in global economic recovery.\n\n\nDuring the quarter there were improvements in both imports and exports, and the trade surplus improved slightly to R430 billion, up 1% from R425 billion reported previously.\n\n\n\"The larger trade surplus resulted from the value of merchandise exports increasing to a new all-time high while the value of imports rose to a lesser extent. The higher value of merchandise exports reflected an increase in prices while merchandise imports resulted from higher volumes,\" the report read.\n\n\nContact: Joyce Ambale, Managing Partner, Africa, E\n:\njambale@taplowgroup.com\n\n\nASIA\n\n\nEconomic activity is expected to grow by 6.9 percent in 2021, slightly lower than predictions in June 2020 in the World Economic Outlook Update.\n\n\nAustralia\n\n\nThe economic rebound continues in Australia. Australia has outperformed every major advanced economy with the National economy having “fully recovered lost output caused by the pandemic by March 31, 2021”.\n\n\nThe economic recovery has been quicker and stronger than forecast with the unemployment rate continuing to decline from 7.4% in July 2020 to 5.5% in April 2021. In addition to this Australia’s AAA credit rating has had its credit outlook raised. Australia remains one of just nine countries to hold a AAA credit rating from the three major rating agencies. The National Accounts released in June saw the economy increase 1.8 per cent in the March quarter with output now 0.8 per cent above its pre-pandemic level. Year-on-year growth of 1.1 per cent was better than the consensus estimates of 0.6 per cent.\n\n\nPrivate investment rose 5.3 per cent in the March quarter to be 3.6 per cent higher through the year, this is the first rise since the June quarter of 2018. Both business and housing investment increased, supported by government initiatives, and improved confidence, with an 11.6 per cent rise in machinery and equipment. This is significant because it is the strongest increase in 11 years since the December quarter 2009. Residential investment rose 6.4 per cent with increased construction activity.\n\n\nConsumer spending has been constrained and remains down on pre-pandemic levels and this has been directed to reductions in household and personal debt with significant reductions in credit card debt and credit cards on issue.\n\n\nContact: Ian Stacy, Managing Partner, Australia, E\n:\nistacy@taplowgroup.com.au\n\n\nChina\n\n\nIncreasing downward pressure on growth in Q2 and may extend in Q4.\n\n\nIt is anticipated increasing downward pressure on growth in this Q2 and may extend in Q4 2021 due to pent-up demand and weaken exports. The tightening property measures and surging raw material prices also attribute to this trend. Although annual growth forecast is more than 8% for this year, there are more risks on the downside. Big concern about the recent surge of raw material prices.\n\n\nChina is to be increasingly alert to the recent surge of raw material prices. \nThe higher prices may suppress the real demand and squeeze margins for firms. The production and supply chain could also be negatively impacted by the higher prices. China has to take measures to secure supplies and aim to maintain a stable RMB. To cope with surging commodity prices, China has already taken action to boost domestic supply of major raw materials such as coal, steel, and electricity.\n\n\nThe rapid drop in the growth of aggregate financing caused concern of further drop space.\nThe rapid drop in the growth of aggregate financing growth might make China concerned the room for further drop in credit growth is limited. It is expected that China may even ease restriction on some types of financing later this year including speed up issuing government bond financing to secure the drop trend of credit growth.\n\n\nSlower export growth exerts downward pressure on China’s economic growth. \nChina is urged to add domestic supplies and keep exchange rate stage of RMB Slower export growth will also exert downward pressure on China’s economic growth in Q2 and urge China to bear the economic costs of its carbon-reduction campaign. Slowing export growth will push China to add supplies to offset surging raw materials prices rather no the appreciation of RMB. RMB exchange rates should be not used as a tool to stimulate exports via depreciation or offset the impact of surging global commodity prices via appreciation. China intends to keep exchange rates largely stable against the basket amid China’s post-Covid recovery.\n\n\nContact: Derek Zhang, Managing Partner, China. E: \nderek.zhang@chinadox.com\n\n\nIndia\n\n\nIndia’s economy is expected to grow at 8.3% for Fiscal Year 2021-22 as per the World Bank’s latest projections. This rate, however, masked the damage caused by the “enormous” second wave of COVID-19. The world economy is expected to expand 5.6%, the fastest post-recession growth rate in eighty years, but global output will still be 2% below pre-pandemic projections by year-end. For India the massive COVID-19 wave had undermined the sharper than expected rebound in activity for the second half of FY 2020-21 – particularly in services.\n\n\nIndia’s employment outlook would be more or less stable for the next quarter of this year, said Manpower Group Employment Outlook Survey conducted across 1303 enterprises in the country. Workforce gains were anticipated in six of the seven industry sectors during the upcoming quarter.\n\n\nTransportation & Utilities sector would be the strongest job market with a net employment outlook of +10%, while the job outlook for Services sector would be +7%. However, Mining & Construction sector employers expected to trim payrolls, reporting a weak outlook of -2%, found the survey. The strongest hiring pace was recorded in the medium sized organisations followed by the large enterprises with a seasonally adjusted outlook of +8% and +6% respectively.\n\n\nHonda could soon be “The New Player in India’s EV Market”. The Honda Benly e-electric scooter was recently spotted testing at the ARAI (Automotive Research Association of India) facility in Pune. The electric utility scooter made its international debut at the 2019 Tokyo Motor Show. Honda had announced earlier that it would be importing an electric two-wheeler from China to test in India, and the Honda Benly could be just that.\n\n\nMcLaren Automotive, the division responsible for some of its revered road cars is said to officially arrive in India. A report on Team-BHP cites its source from Instagram which suggest that the supercar maker could announce its India plans and model prices soon. It is reported that McLaren will expand its footprint to the Indian market with one dealership. Reports suggest that Infinity Cars will hold the rights to the super and hypercars from McLaren Automotive.\n\n\nContact: Sangeeta Sabharwal, Managing Partner, India E:\n \nsangeeta.sabharwal@taplowgroupindia.com\n\n\nNew Zealand\n\n\nWestpac Bank (Westpac) reported in a recent economic report that it has been roughly a year since New Zealand exited its Covid-19 related lockdown and the economic impacts of the virus are still being felt. New Zealand’s tourism and hospitality sectors are continuing to struggle with the loss of international tourist dollars. And while the recent establishment of travel bubbles with Australia and the Cook Islands has been welcome news, the sector will face big challenges while long-haul travel remains off the cards.\n\n\nWestpac also reported that the labour market is continuing to firm, with unemployment now down to 4.7%. They are also seeing resilience in household spending, especially on durable items. And on top of that, business sector indicators are pointing to a firming in trading activity, with an increasing number of businesses looking at taking on new staff or increasing their capex.\n\n\nOverall Westpac report that economic activity remains a bit below pre-Covid levels. However, the recovery is gaining traction. And with continued support from monetary and fiscal policy, Westpac expect domestic economic activity will continue to firm through the back half of 2021 and into 2022. Over time, growth will also be boosted by the rollout of vaccines here and abroad, which will allow for restrictions on international travel to be relaxed. However, that’s likely to occur only gradually, with GDP set to remain below the path it was on before the pandemic for some time yet.\n\n\nIn terms of the labour market, Westpac report that lower net migration will reduce the pool of available workers in some industries, which signals a related lift in wage pressures. However, with the Government looking at a targeted tightening of migration settings, impacts will be varied across sectors. In particular, Westpac believe we are likely to see fewer unskilled workers arriving, which will be particularly important in areas like\n\n\nContact: Graeme Sandri, Managing Partner, New Zealand, E\n: \ngraeme@swr.nz\n\n\nEUROPE\n\n\nConcerns over new variants of COVID-19 are not effecting business recovery. However, vaccinations are progressing and thus Europe’s GDP growth is projected to rebound by 4.5 percent in 2021.\n\n\nDenmark\n\n\nBeing a small country with an open economy and a structural balance of payments surplus, Denmark’s economy – although prosperous - is highly dependent on foreign trade. This is why the country recorded its deepest fall in GDP in the first half 2020 due to the COVID-19 crisis. As both domestic and external demand normalises, Denmark’s real GDP is forecast to expand by a solid 2.8% in 2021 and around 2.9% in 2022. The Danish economy is characterized by an equitable distribution of income and extensive government welfare measures, with one of the highest GDP per capita in the world.\n\n\nThe two segments impacted the most by the Pandemic are here below and are now both in good progress to recover and rebound.\n\n\nIndustry employs around 18% of the active population and contributes 20.9% of GDP. The major activity sectors are the chemical, pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, with niche industries in renewable energy and biotechnology. Denmark has limited natural resources, a fact that slows down the development of its heavy industry. However, the country has enough oil and gas reserves to ensure its energy independence.\n\n\nThe services sector contributes almost three-quarters of GDP (64.9%) and employs the largest share of the population (80%). Denmark has a strong banking sector, characterized by a high degree of concentration: domestic banks own more than 85% of the total assets, and three banks control 50% of total assets. Shipping, trade and transportation services are also important for the country’s economy (Denmark is the world’s fifth-largest shipping operator).\n\n\nContact: Ole Norby, Managing Partner, Denmark E:\n \nonb@taplow.dk\n\n\nFrance\n\n\nIn the midst of a recession, the French economy still managed to create jobs. The 0.1% contraction in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the first quarter - following a 1.5% decline in the fourth quarter of 2020 - was accompanied by 88,800 net private jobs created an increase of 0.5%, according to data just released by the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (Insee). In total, between October 2020 and March 2021, the French economy created nearly 60,000 net private jobs despite the contraction of national wealth due to lockdowns.\n\n\nThe latest business surveys, published by both INSEE (the employment climate has returned to its long-term average) and IHS Markit (the employment component of the PMI indices is growing strongly), seem to send rather positive signals for the French employment outlook in the months ahead.\n\n\nFor the second year in a row, France remained the European country that attracted the most foreign direct investment in 2020, with 985 projects, despite a sharp drop against the backdrop of the Covid-19 crisis, according to an annual survey published in early June by the firm EY. The investors questioned believe that France has \"relatively well defended its attractiveness\", particularly \"thanks to the support measures and the recovery plan\" announced last autumn. Nearly half of them believe that the plan is more effective than in other European countries. With an 18% drop in foreign investment, France has suffered a sharper decline than the United Kingdom (-12%), which is close behind France with 975 projects, while Germany (930 projects) has limited its decline to 4%. According to EY, this is mainly due to the weight in the French economy of three sectors that are highly exposed to the Covid-19 crisis: aeronautics, automotive and tourism. In detail, industrial equipment and the transport and logistics sector have suffered with a number of projects almost halved. The digital sector has also suffered a sharp decline even if it remains at the top of the projects. Conversely, projects in the pharmaceutical sector have more than doubled, from 26 to 58.\n\n\nContact: Stéphane Martinod, Managing Partner, France, E:\n \nsmartinod@taplowgroup.com\n\n\nGermany\n\n\nDIW Berlin significantly lowers growth forecast for 2021 to 3.0 percent; 3.8 percent currently expected for 2022, Problems in the corporate sector masked by the suspension of duty for companies to file for insolvency and state aid - number of corporate insolvencies likely to rise significantly\n\n\n\"The German economy is overcoming the pandemic-related crisis and is at the start of a strong upswing,\" writes the Bundesbank in its projection for the years 2021 to 2023.\n\n\nExperts expect strong catch-up effects, particularly in the previously particularly impaired service sectors and in private consumption. In addition, the upturn will be driven by exports, which will benefit from the only gradual slowdown in the recovery of world trade.\n\n\nUnder these conditions, the Bundesbank expects calendar-adjusted real gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by just under 4 percent and a good 5 percent respectively in the current and coming year. In 2023, growth should then be somewhat weaker at almost 2 percent. \"\"The pre-crisis level will be reached again as early as this summer,\"\" the report states.\n\n\nThe general atmosphere in public in Germany is increasing. Business spirit improves. The partial lockdown is eased, slower than in other counties, step by step, differently from state to state. Shops, hospitality, restaurants, travel, all kind of events are still somehow limited. Covid-Infection numbers decrease significantly. Vaccination is improving but not faster than in other EU countries. Government recovery spending shall continue in Q3.\n\n\nMost production sectors had grown from export only in this year. Currently many companies face chip shortage problems and cannot produce equipment as demanded. Also car production is effected with a significant shortage. Production and retail sectors now complain congestion in delivery from and to East Asia caused by improving demands and by cargo ships operating under full workload and often in other areas of the planet.\n\n\nOnline delivery and logistics sectors are still performing well while other sectors show mixed results. Companies continue digital transformation and cost cutting efforts.\n\n\nIf possible, employees should still work from home. Next month an office work rate of more than 30% is expected. Unemployment remains low due to short-work programs.\n\n\nContact: Peter Knoblich, Senior Partner, Germany, E:\n \nakoechling@taplowgroup.com\n\n\nContact: Bernd Schlosshauer, Senior Partner, Germany, E\n: \nbrs@berndschlosshauer.de\n\n\nItaly\n\n\nItaly’s virus-hit economy is expected to grow 4.1% this year and 4.2% in 2022.\n\n\nEconomic forecasters have cut its initial growth estimates for Italy, published in October, by 0.7 percentage points for this year due to weaker-than-expected growth in the final quarter of 2020 and the first three months of 2021.\n\n\nItaly’s deficit at 7.8% of GDP this year and at 4.8% in 2022. Hikes in government spending to support the economy drove the country’s deficit to 9.5% of GDP at the end of last year.\n\n\nThere will be new mergers in the Italian banking sector over the coming months, the CEO of Italy’s largest bank by market capitalization has predicted.\n\n\nSpeaking to CNBC’s, Intesa Sanpaolo CEO Carlo Messina said: “I think that in the next year, so within 12 months, there will be some M&A deal in the country. I don’t know what kind of bank can be merged or put together, but the future for the country is to enter into another season of merger(s).”\n\n\nHis comment comes after S&P Global Market Intelligence said in a note in March that Italy is on the cusp of being “the busiest market for bank mergers in Europe in 2021.”\n\n\nContact: Giovanna Brambilla, Managing Partner, Italy, E: \ngiovanna.brambilla@valuesearch.it\n\n\nNorway\n\n\nUnemployment has finally begun to decrease and is currently 145,000 people (registered) 6.4%. Folio rate from Bank of Norway has been 0 percent for the past 11 months. Economists expect this rate to be increased 1 or 2 times during second half of 2021, and further in 2022.\n\n\nDespite low interest rate Norwegians has record high private savings in banks. Expected to be caused by reduced ability to travel and activity in cultural events, as well as fine dining.\n\n\nMany industries are slowly starting to get back to where they were before Covid, but many are still suffering.\n\n\nContact: Hans Holter - Sorensen, Managing Partner, Norway, E: \nhhs@taplow.no\n  \n\n\nRussia\n\n\nAccording to the 45th Russian Economic Report by the World Bank, Russia’s GDP contraction of 3,0% is relatively better compared to the world economy with 3,8% or advanced economies with 5,4%. This was mainly achieved by macro-fiscal stabilization efforts, regulation and supervision in the banking sector, stronger connections to China, small service sector and large public sector that stabilized growth in unemployment. The report presents a GDP growth forecast of 3,2% for both 2021 and 2022. For 2023 it is 2,3%. Higher oil prices, global economic recovery and mild domestic monetary conditions are expected to support Russia’s recovery.\n\n\nThe Central Bank chief Elvira Nabiullina warned at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) that the current inflation could not be seen as only a temporary trend, rather more a serious threat to Russia’s economic recovery. The current inflation rate of 5,5% is above the Central Bank’s target of 4%.\n\n\nRussian and Belarusian relations have been empowered with the second instalment of a billion-dollar loan to Belarus. Belarus’ Finance Ministry received USD 500 million on the 2nd of June. The EU imported $1.5 billion of chemicals and another $1.3 billion energy products from Belarus last year. Belarus is preparing for new EU sanctions on its vital export industries.\n\n\nRussia’s Ministry of Economic Development decided to increase its planned expenses on the electric vehicle support program from 418 billion RUB to 777 billion RUB.\n\n\nTo reduce its carbon footprint of domestic products, Russia decided to launch “green certificates” from March 2022. These certificates are supposed to create a system within Russia to prove that industrial goods were produced using electricity from renewable and low-carbon sources.\n\n\nContact: Henric Nilsson, Managing Partner, Russia, E:\n \nhenric.nilsson@humansearch.ru\n\n\nSpain\n\n\nIn its outlook report, OCDE institution forecasts that Spain's gross domestic product will increase by 5.9% in 2021 and 6.3% in 2022 thanks to the progress of the vaccination campaign, which will allow and facilitate the gradual recovery of tourism.\n\n\nFrom the second half of 2021 onwards, the economy will experience significant dynamism spurred by the various measures of the national recovery plan. The easing of restrictions and uncertainty will translate into a drop in savings that will boost consumption and a significant increase in investment.\n\n\nHowever, the OECD warns of a \"risk\" factor in this idyllic recovery: \"the increase in [business] insolvencies once government aid is removed\". Thus, the withdrawal of fiscal stimuli should, according to the report, be \"gradual\" once the economy is on a stable growth path.\n\n\nThe economic think tank puts special emphasis on the situation of companies and the labour market. \"If the crisis lasts longer than expected, it may be necessary to increase the amount of funding for this type of direct aid,\" the OECD points out, referring to direct aid aimed at protecting the business fabric, which, in its opinion, should be implemented \"quickly\".\n\n\nAs for employment, the head of division in the OECD's Economics Department, Aída Caldera, recalls that Spain has one of the highest rates of temporary employment in the EU, a negative factor for productivity as it encourages a reduction in investment and generates excessive mobility. Therefore, the economist advises \"clarifying and limiting the ways in which temporary employment can be contracted\".\n\n\nContact: Carmen Alarcon, Managing Partner, Spain, E:\n \ncalarcon@taplowgroup.com\n\n\nUK\n\n\nThe UK economy grew by 2.3% in April as the easing of Covid-19 lockdown measures fuelled a rebound in consumer spending, according to official figures.\n\n\nThe UK hosted the G7 summit a few days ago in Cornwall, the annual summit of the heads of government and state of the UK, US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan. The EU, Australia, India, South Africa, and South Korea were in attendance with numerous initiatives announced to tackle the pandemic, economic development and climate change.\n\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said GDP rose for the third consecutive month as pandemic restrictions were scaled back across all four nations of the UK, with the economy growing at the fastest pace since the July reopening from lockdown last year.\n\n\nRetail sales grew sharply as non-essential shops reopened, alongside a pickup in bookings for caravan parks and holiday lets, and the reopening of hospitality venues outdoors lifted spending in pubs, bars and restaurants. Overall GDP grew by 1.5% in the three months to April compared with the previous three months.\n\n\nRishi Sunak, the chancellor, said the latest figures were “a promising sign that our economy is beginning to recover”. The ONS said the annual rate of growth in April was 27.6%, demonstrating the difference from the worst month of the pandemic a year earlier, as the economy recovers from the biggest collapse in output for more than 300 years.\n\n\nHowever, further ground remains to be recovered, with the economy still about 4% below its pre-pandemic level as concerns mount over the fallout from rising Covid infections fuelled by the Delta variant, first detected in India.\n\n\nContact: Mark Firth, Managing Partner, UK, E:\n \nmfirth@taplowgroup.com\n\n\nAMERICAS\n\n\nRegional economic activity is projected to grow by 3.7% in 2021, stock markets, key commodity prices and external conditions improve.\n\n\nBrazil\n\n\nAccording to the June 8, 2021 “Conjuncture Letter” from IPEA “Institute for Applied Economic Research”, an institute sheltered by the Economy Ministry of Brazil, the Brazilian internal demand for local and imported industrial goods fell by 4.5% in April last, representing a 2.6% drop in local demand, a retreat of 10.6% in the imported industrial goods in the moving quarter ended in April, against an increase of 10% in the previous period.\n\n\nIn the interannual comparison, the demand for industrial good increase by 28.9% against April of 2020. As a result, the moving quarter showed an increase of 15.6% in comparison with the same period of 2020. Taking as a basis the 12-month accumulated variance, total demand registered a null variance whilst industrial production accumulated a 1.1% growth, according to IBGE the “Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics”, an official government organ.\n\n\nAccording to IPEA, Brazilian work force totalled 85.6 million people in March last, a fall of 4.8% as compared to March 2020 (89.9 million), after a retreat of 2.6%, versus March 2019. March 2021 has seen a retreat of 0.3% in the occupied work force, as compared to the previous month.\n\n\nThe formal/legally registered employment mass, for the last 12-month period, has grown by 1,935 million workers, whereas 2021 year-to-date growth reached 957.889 jobs. Despite of the expansion of the employed had grown as from 80.3 million to 86.1 million – July 2020-January 2021, the unemployed rate has stabilized in 14.1%, yet a high figure in this regard.\n\n\nIPEA shows that the pandemic has been particularly grave toward the younger and lesser educated groups. In the fourth quarter of 2020, those between 18 and 24 years old were most affected by unemployment also, peaking at 29.8%, meaning that there are almost 4.1 million youngsters looking for inexistent jobs.\n\n\nFor those with education below high school, unemployment rate grew from 18.5% to 23.7%, from the fourth quarter of 2019 and the same period of 2020.\n\n\nWith the apparent end of the “Emergency Aid” (pandemic social program of cash giving away), ranging from R$ 150,00 (US$ 28.00) to R$ 375,00 (US$ 70.00), with an average value of R$ 250,00 (US$ 47.00), it is expected that a large amount of unemployed people will actively look for employment.\n\n\nAs regards current perspective for the Brazilian labour market, IPEA points out that even with the acceleration of the economic activity, for the second semester of this year, the expected newly generated jobs will not be sufficient to take care of the huge unemployed mass of people and, as previously mentioned, the most adversely affected will be the youngest groups.\n\n\nContact: Tácito Bocaiuva, Managing Partner,\n \nBrazil, E\n: \ntbocaiuva@taplowgroup.com\n\n\nUSA\n\n\nMinority and Female candidate requirements are increasing. As we include diverse representation in each assignment it has not changed our approach but continues to be an articulated expectation – an advantage for us.\n\n\nInterest is increasing in specialty skills in all aspects of business including but not limited to environmental and other socially responsible criteria – we note that some recently announced hires are experts in the policy issues but have not had the practical exposure to the experts in the products or strategies which they will be advising on the socially responsible issues. Investment managers have to be particularly careful not to lose performance and require expertise in Socially Responsible Investment regardless of the staff scarcity.\n\n\nMeasurement experts for the impact of SRI are in high demand but there are challenges in the basis for measurements and remediation.\n\n\nEmployment and GDP appear to continue to rise almost unabated. Modest inflation is viewed as likely and to the extent that cost increases ($34,000 just for lumber for new homes – almost 2x prior to the current building surge) demand is slowing slightly.\n\n\nMicrochip shortages are dramatically impacting automobile and many other high cost manufactured products leading to dramatic increases in pricing for used cars and construction equipment.\n\n\nContact: Steve Schrenzel, Managing Partner, USA, E\n: \nsschrenzel@taplowes.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3362)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "5 Ways The New Normal is Shaping The Future of Human Capital Search\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nMonday, June 14, 2021\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 2.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nHuman Capital is defined as the total economic value extracted out of the skills, experience, and expertise of your workforce. Many leaders say that human capital is the single most valuable asset owned by an organization that is not recorded in the balance sheets. It also encompasses the virtues like integrity, honesty, and punctuality.\nHuman capital development\n is essential for the growth of an organization. It is the human capital that drives the financial capital and other assets for your organization.\n\n\n\r\nJust like every other field, industry, and sector, the global pandemic has brought in huge transformations in human capital services as well. Here’s how the New Normal is Shaping the Future of Human Capital Search\n\n\n\n\n1.\n The duration of recruitment cycles has increased. Though it varies from industry to industry, yet it can go as long as six months to fill one position. It is now even more challenging to find the right match for the open positions. You need efficient \n human capital search services\n to scout and hunt for the right talent in the new normal.\n\n\n\n\n2.\n Human capital services would allow you to focus on your core business expertise while the hiring consultants will take care of the entire recruitment process. The human capital consultants know the present market scenarios, your business process, and the new normal has affected both these areas. Leverage their services to create the best pool of talent for your organization.\n\n\n\n\n3.\n The new normal has highlighted the importance of the digital world and the impact of technology on the workforce. A recent PWC report has stated that in the future almost 55% of jobs are going to be replaced by artificial intelligence. You need to have a workforce that is resilient and adaptive. Your workforce must be digitally aligned in this new world. They have to constantly update and upskill themselves to survive in this technology-driven world.\n\n\n\n\n4.\n Another major challenge is cultural mapping within the organization. Previously, when all employees came together under one roof, one organizational culture was infused in them. But now the organizational culture is impacted by different regional and communal cultures. It makes it complicated, and you need experienced \n human capital search consultants\n to understand how your business processes can be perfectly aligned in this intermix of multiple cultures.\n\n\n\n\n5.\n Finally, there is the rise of the gig economy. With the remote working model, many prefer part-time engagements to full-time jobs. People can now work with organizations in the US sitting in Australia or India without any hassle. Most employees are engaged in multiple activities and work with complete flexibility. This gives room for staff augmentation where you can get bright and innovative ideas from across the globe and reduce recruitment costs at the same time.\n\n\n\r\nLeader need to ask – \"\nIs our workforce aligned to deal with this new normal\n\" and come out as champions in the dynamic landscape of the business world? Partner with the best human capital services and build a resilient workforce that can stand any change and convert every challenge into a new opportunity.\n\n\n\r\nAt The Taplow Group we not only help you source the best-fit for your organization’s leadership through our \n human capital services\n but also train and develop them to hone their skills.

    "content": "Sucession Planning - Why's it Needed\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nTuesday, June 8, 2021\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 3.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nThere's an adage that sums up the advantages of succession planning perfectly: \"if you fail to plan, you plan to fail.\" When your business is running smoothly, and the economy and your financial future appear secure, it can be difficult to take a step back and consider what would happen if one of the building blocks suddenly disappeared.\n\n\n\r\nThe goal of \n Leadership Development Management Services\n is to make you well versed with the term of succession planning and making your organization strong enough in the time t of a sudden change. Your company may not get a second chance if it does not adapt immediately and fills up the void caused by the sudden disappearance of the building block, because you failed to create an orderly succession plan. No organization can ever predict when a serious illness, accident, disaster, or pandemic will strike, but they can always plan for what they'll need to do if it does.\n\n\n\r\nFurther we shall discuss how disaster management is an inevitable part of an organization, succession planning too has become another important function to be taken care of also why and how succession planning is important.\n\n\n\n\nDisaster Control Methods\n\r\nMany business owners are so preoccupied with their company's day-to-day operations that they overlook succession planning. These leaders may believe that they are too young to suffer from a serious illness. Alternatively, they may overlook the possibility that a key player (or several) will be lured away by another company in need of their expertise and willing to pay top dollar for them. Any of these scenarios could make a company particularly vulnerable.\n\n\n\n\nThe Eternal Retention Tool\n\r\nMost importantly, succession planning allows ambitious, less-experienced internal candidates to know that their hard work and skills have been recognized and valued enough to be considered for advancement. For junior managers and subject matter experts who want to advance their careers into management, this can be an excellent retention tool and motivator.\n\n\n\n\nTraining Research and Development\n\r\nCoaching, mentoring, job shadowing, or a gradual increase in more advanced responsibilities may all be part of Leadership development coaching. Other jobs may even require the candidate to return to school to obtain additional training or certification.\n\n\n\r\nBy identifying potential successors early on, you give employees the time to gain the skills and experience they'll need to succeed in senior positions. You also demonstrate to employees that you are willing to invest in their personal development and the companies.\n\n\n\n\nNotice what's Happening \n\r\nExplaining the status quo is a simple process that helps reveal flaws in processes and procedures and sales opportunities and opportunities for positive change. This natural process allows your company to keep an extra set of eyes on its senior roles and encourages questioning outdated or inefficient corporate norms. This also creates a healthy competition in the corporate setting; which initiates a sense of fear which allows them to always be one step ahead.\n\n\n\n\nGrowing with the organization.\n\r\nOften we hear--- immediately after a shift of core in company -- organization make or break -- leaders are not well versed with the organization-- succession planning help -- should be within the organization.\n\n\n\r\nYou hear a lot about CEOs who come in from the outside with a lot of promise, only to fail after a short time. Unfortunately, such poor hires frequently harm the company's reputation and long-term growth.\n\n\n\r\nThis usually occurs because the new CEO is unfamiliar with its fundamental values and mission. After all, they haven't \"grown-up\" with it. They move the \n Leadership Development Management Services Firm\n away from its core brand because they want to put their stamp on it or because they don't understand customer needs.\n\n\n\r\nOne of the advantages of succession planning is that it can help your business avoid this. By identifying and grooming an internal successor, your company ensures that it will be led by someone who shares its values and has firsthand experience with the company's brand promise, customers, and employees.\n\n\n\n\nDeeproot, your organization\n\r\nA succession plan's goal is to help your company grow with purpose while identifying and preparing for vulnerabilities in other business areas. Other advantages of succession planning include:\n\r\n1. Assisting in determining which areas require innovation.\n\r\n2. Setting realistic growth goals.\n\r\n3. Anticipating future talent needs that may arise due to that growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (6108)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Macroeconomic policies will in many countries entail some difficult choices.\n\n\nSouth Africa\n\n\nGovernment welcomed the International Monetary Fund’s\n (IMF) revised upward growth outlook of South Africa from 2.8% to 3.1% for 2021. The upgrade to South Africa's growth outlook affirms the robustness of the economy and positive economic interventions despite tough conditions.\n\n\nThe projected 3.1% growth\n follows a period where economic activity decreased by 7.0% in 2020 compared with 2019 due to the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Based on historical data, this is the biggest annual fall in economic activity the country has seen since at least 1946. Prior to the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic activity in South Africa increased by 0.2% in 2019, following an increase of 0.8% in 2018. The annual real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 0.2% in 2019 was primarily led by increased economic activity in finance, real estate, and business services, as well as general government and personal services.\n\n\nThe IMF growth projection revision\n is attributed to the additional fiscal support in large economies and the global roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines. South Africa’s own vaccination roll-out programme holds the potential to further uplift and turn the economy around.\n\n\n Contact: Joyce Ambale, Managing Partner, Africa, E: \njambale@taplowgroup.com\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nASIA\n\n\n\n\nThe Asia and Pacific region are starting to recover tentatively, but at multiple speeds. Economic activity is expected to grow by 6.9 percent in 2021—0.6 percentage point lower and 0.3 percentage point higher, respectively, than in the June 2020 World Economic Outlook Update.\n\n\nAustralia\n\n\nAustralia has reported its Annual Federal Government Budget this month.\n Last year, Australia’s economy amid the global pandemic contracted by just 2.5%, this contrasts strongly against other economies of the United Kingdom, France and Italy that all contracted by more than 8% and Australia has seen employment go above its pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\nThe underlying cash balance for 2020/21 is estimated at 8% of GDP\n, S&P maintained its negative outlook for Australia’s AAA credit rating and has said that a narrowing in the deficit towards 3% of GDP is more consistent with a AAA rating. The outlook for the Australian economy is that it will continue to recover over the next couple of years. It is forecast that business investment will increase in the near term; housing investment will continue with new house starts now the highest in 20 years.\n\n\nIt is also forecast that Government sees stronger consumption\n and a bigger contribution from net exports and unemployment falling below 5% in the near term with weak wage growth. Government spending will continue to turbocharge the national economy with significant spending in key sectors particularly health, defence, and infrastructure. \n*Sources Federal Treasurer and NAB\n\n\nChina\n\n\nChina will remain cautious about high rate of export growth.\n The stimulus policy made by developed countries (especially the US) triggered demand for products manufactured in China, while the worsening Covid-19 pandemic in many emerging markets including India as one competitor also accelerate the export from China as backup. However, China will remain cautious as the currently high rate of export growth may not sustain.\n\n\nSurging prices of imported commodities sustain China’s “no sharp shift” policy\n stance. China is also alert to the surging prices of imported commodities which can both trigger higher inflation and depress domestic demand. That is why China may stick to its “no sharp shift” policy stance, although there is elevated trend of export growth.\n\n\nChina releases 7th population census data.\n Total population numbers 1.41 billion and sex ratio heading to a more balanced direction. More Chinese moving to eastern region and round 850,000 foreigners living in China. The census data raised the concern the low annual population growth and high percentage of aged person.\n\n\nChina's consumer price index up 0.9% in April and tightening the prices surge of\n property sector. Rising international commodity prices pushed up China's producer price index. High increase of exports supports China’s recovery and may also support China’s tough stance on tightening policy on the property sector in big cities.\n\n\n Contact: Derek Zhang, Managing Partner, China, E: \nderek.zhang@chinadox.com\n\n\nIndia\n\n\nMoody’s Investors Service joined other rating agencies slashing its FY22 economic growth\n forecast for India from 13.7% estimated earlier to 9.3%, citing negative impact of the second wave of coronavirus pandemic. The rating agency cautioned that risks from deeper stresses in the economy and financial system could lead to a more severe and prolonged erosion in fiscal strength, exerting further pressure on the credit profile of Asia’s third largest economy.\n\n\nHero MotoCorp\n ties up with Taiwan's Gogoro Inc with focus on electric mobility. The country's largest two-wheeler maker Hero MotoCorp has partnered with Taiwan-based Gogoro Inc., to collaborate in the field of electric mobility.

The Israeli embassy announced that a partnership has been initiated by the International Federation of Indo-Israel Chambers of Commerce (IFIICC) through which an Israel-based company is producing an innovative robotic solar technology in India for a landmark project in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This is a first-of-its-kind trilateral cooperation between India, Israel and the UAE\n\n\nElectric Vehicle (EV)\n space sees top level hiring to fill up new technology advancements. Experts maintain that with the EV business at an inflection point and poised to grow exponentially, companies in this space are getting more focussed on the talent eco-system, which is technical and specialised in nature. With corporates staying bullish on their electric vehicle (EV) plans, they have upped the ante regarding top level hiring.\n\n\n Contact: Sangeeta Sabharwal, Managing Partner, India E: \nsangeeta.sabharwal@taplowgroupindia.com\n\n\nSingapore\n\n\nSingapore's gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 2 per cent\n between January and March, extending the 3.8 per cent growth in the previous quarter, advance estimates by the Ministry of Trade and Industry.\n\n\n\"The expansion is a strong signal that our economy\n is slowly but surely recovering from the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 last year,\" said Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing.\n\n\n Contact: Lee Fang Xing, Managing Partner, Singapore, E: \nlfang@taplowgroup.com\n\n\nNew Zealand\n\n\nEconomic Outlook:\n In their February Quarterly Economic Outlook, ANZ Bank expect that it will take until early 2022 for some form of normalisation to occur to the New Zealand economy. They anticipate that International tourism and education will resume, and household spending patterns will shift with households willing to spend more as incomes grow and travel again. Unfortunately, more travel by New Zealanders means more spending overseas and less in New Zealand.\n\n\nInternational Travel Bubble Opens:\n The New Zealand Government announced that travel between New Zealand and Australia will be quarantine-free from 19th April 2021. This was soon followed by the announcement that travel between New Zealand and Rarotonga would also be quarantine-free from the 17th of May 2021.\n\n\nTourism New Zealand\n estimates quarantine-free travel between Australia and New Zealand resuming soon could bring in $1 billion to the economy by the end of the year. Despite solid domestic tourism, there is an estimated $12.9 billion expected gap from the loss of international visitors. The return of Australian visitors will go some way to helping reduce this gap. Australians spent $2.7 billion in New Zealand in 2019.\n\n\nPrior to COVID-19, Australians made up almost 40% of international arrivals\n to New Zealand and contributed around 24% or $2.7 billion of New Zealand's annual international visitor spend.\n\n\nUnemployment Rate Falls Again:\n New Zealand’s unemployment rate fell to 4.7% in the March Quarter. This was down from the previous quarters rate of 4.9%. The labour market in New Zealand is extremely tight which is a good signal that then labour market is in good shape, which is completely against the predictions that were being made when New Zealand headed into the Covid crisis.\n\n\nSupply Chain and Shipping Delays Impacting:\n Temporary shipping delays caused by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic is leading to shortages of products across New Zealand industries. These are likely to continue until the end of the year, experts say.\n\n\n Contact: Graeme Sandri, Managing Partner, New Zealand, E: \ngraeme@swr.nz\n\n\n\n\nEurope\n\n\n\n\nWith new waves of COVID-19 infections hitting Europe, the recovery remains static. However, vaccinations are progressing and thus Europe’s GDP growth is projected to rebound by 4.5 percent in 2021.\n\n\nDenmark\n\n\nThe Danish economy\n has been constrained by a long lockdown until April 2021. The hospitality industry has been especially influenced by this. Denmark's real GDP is forecast to expand by a solid 2.8% in 2021 and around 2.9% in 2022 according to the IMF. The number is low due to the low commercial activity at Q1 but is expected to increase later this year.\n\n\nThe latest lockdown has increased unemployment\n to 4.6% of the workforce, but not as much as the start of 2020 where it peaked at 5.6%. In the Capital Region of Denmark, the unemployment rate reached 6.7% in Q1 2021. Nevertheless, the highest unemployment rate was documented in the Region of North Denmark.\n\n\n Contact: Ole Norby, Managing Partner, Denmark E: \nonb@taplow.dk\n\n\nFinland\n\n\n2021 GDP growth will be 2.6%, supported by the strengthening of private consumption towards the end of the year. In 2022, GDP growth will continue to gather pace and reach 2.7%, reflecting a gradual pick-up in investment. In 2023, economic growth will slow to close to 1% and approach the level of potential output in the economy.\n\n\nThe employment rate decreased by just under one percentage point\n, to 71.6% in 2020, but will return to pre-pandemic levels in 2022. During the COVID-19 crisis, jobs have been lost particularly in services. Although the crisis has weakened employment in services, the effects may only be temporary as the demand for services returns. Much of the employment growth in recent years has taken place in services. Towards the end of the forecast period, improvements in employment will be impeded by slow economic growth and a further contraction in the working-age population\n\n\n Timo Toivanen, Managing Partner, Finland, E: \nTimo.Toivanen@taplow.fi\n\n\nFrance\n\n\nFor the month of May, with the easing of sanitary constraints, business leaders anticipate an improvement in activity in both industry and services. In industry, the recovery is expected to be marked in the pharmaceutical industry; activity is expected to increase in the automotive sector, although it will remain relatively weak.\n\n\nProduction in the aeronautics and other transport sector\n is also expected to remain well below its pre-crisis level. The increase in activity should be more significant in services than in industry. In the accommodation and food services sector, the easing of sanitary measures would allow a slight recovery in activity, which would nevertheless remain at very low levels. The improvement would also be noticeable in leisure activities and personal services, as well as in equipment rental (automobiles, etc.). The improvement would be less significant in business services. In the construction sector, activity is expected to be stable, at a level very close to its pre-crisis level.\n\n\nThus, economic activity would rebound rapidly in May to - 4%\n, below the pre-crisis level, and then to - 2.5% in June, reaching the August 2020 high point. In industry, the recovery is expected to continue, particularly in those sectors benefiting from the lifting of sanitary restrictions (food industry, which could benefit from the gradual recovery of the restaurant sector).\n\n\nSimilarly, construction is expected to be boosted by strong demand, as suggested by the business surveys, and this is linked to the recovery in investment by municipalities at this stage of the electoral cycle. It should be noted that the 2021 departmental and regional elections will take place on the 20th and 27th of June 2021.\n\n\nMarket services should reach a level of activity\n similar to that of the end of the third quarter of 2020, with a notable rebound in trade - with the reopening of \"non-essential\" stores -, in accommodation and food services and transport services - with a rebound in French and foreign tourism, and the reopening of establishments -, and in other service activities - with the resumption of cultural and sports activities.\n\n\nNon-market services are expected to be stable\n, above normal, with the decline in COVID tests being offset by the continuation of vaccination and the catching up of operations that had to be postponed in the health context of recent months. Overall, in the second quarter of 2021, GDP would be about 4% below the pre-crisis level, slightly higher than in the first quarter of 2021 (about +0.25%). At the end of the first half of 2021, the annual growth rate would then be +4.25%. However, this scenario of a rebound in activity in May and especially in June remains surrounded by uncertainty: it is conditional, in on the lockdown ending.\n\n\n Contact: Stéphane Martinod, Managing Partner, France, E: \nsmartinod@taplowgroup.com\n\n\nGermany\n\n\nIn 2021, it is expected that economic output in Germany will expand by 3.5%\n year-on-year. Growth in the first quarter is currently expected to remain considerably weak due to the rising number of infections and renewed restrictions at the beginning of 2021. However, as the third wave of infection subsides and vaccines becoming more easily available throughout Germany the economic recovery should continue at a somewhat faster pace.\n\n\nData from German Central Bank shows these indicators:\n Cross all sectors production and order entry in March was positive and turned negative numbers from 1st of January onwards into positive ones over all in Q1, this applies to retail, trade and services as well. Loans to non-financial firms declined ca. 1% and those to private institutions and households increased about 1% similarly, savings of households grew 6% on annual basis while debts grew 4% approximately, all data median on 12 months basis.\n\n\nGermany's unemployment rate had been at a record low of around 5%\n. On average around 44.8 million people were employed in Germany in 2020. The unemployment rate is expected to continue to grow slowly in the coming months and will only start to decline in the 3rd quarter of 2021.\n\n\n \nContact: Andreas C. Köchling, Senior Partner, Germany, E: \nakoechling@taplowgroup.com\n\n\nNorway\n\n\nUnemployment is 211,000 people\n (registered) 7,6%, being the highest since world war II, and increased since Q1. GNP for 2020 ended on a drop of 2.5%. Less than anticipated in January.\n\n\nFolio rate from Bank of Norway has been 0 percent for the past 10 months. Economists expect this rate to be increased 1 or 2 times during second half of 2021, and further in 2022.\n\n\nDespite low interest rate Norwegians has record high private savings in banks.\n Expected to be caused by reduced ability to travel and activity in cultural events, as well as fine dining.\n\n\nMany industries are slowly starting to get back to where they were before Covid\n, but many are still suffering. Heavy industry: oil, gas, aluminium and fishery are still suffering. Crude oil has recently experienced positivity in production and pricing, but it is still difficult to see how this can relate to the actual supply and demand on a global level. Expected to drop before it increases further.\n\n\nClassic political economical tools are sourcing billions of Euros into infrastructure\n, aiding the construction business. May 10th, the Norwegian Government reported a record-high use of savings into regular economy.\n\n\n Contact: Hans Holter-Sorensen, Managing Partner, Norway, E: \nhhs@taplow.no\n\n\nRussia\n\n\nThe Economic Ministry in Moscow expects a GDP growth of 2.9 % for 2021\n, which is below the estimate of the IMF for global growth. However, this is related to the fact that Russia’s GPD of 2020 decreased only by 3 %, less than for most other countries. The Russian Economic Ministry further estimates a decline of unemployment from 5.8% to 5.2% for 2021 and an increase in wages of around 2%.\n\n\nChina and countries within the Eurasian Tradeunion managed to increase their trading within Russia\n, whereas the EU saw a slight decline of 3%, but remains Russia’s most important trading partner. The Government expects growth of imports by 10% and exports by 24%, mainly related to the increased pricing of oil and gas.\n\n\nWith the Roadmap 2030, the Government wants to fund around 140 projects with an investment volume of 5 billion EUR within the chemical industry.\n Russia’s goal is to grow this sector (especially fine chemicals) to reduce imports and increase the own production.\n\n\nAnother sector still on the rise is the Agricultural Industry. It is one of the most steadily developing sectors in the country. Also, neighbouring Kazakhstan has now started to plan the expansion of its agricultural sector and is finalising a new investment plan.\n\n\n Contact: Henric Nilsson, Managing Partner, Russia, E: \nhenric.nilsson@humansearch.ru\n\n\nSpain\n\n\nSpain will be the fastest-growing European economy this year, according to the EU The European Commission has upgraded its growth forecast for Spain to 5.9%\n this year and 6.8% next year. “The strong rebound expected from the second quarter of 2021 should allow Spanish GDP to return to its pre-pandemic level by the end of 2022\", says the Commission in its latest spring projections.\n\n\nThe EU executive stresses that the implementation of Spain’s Recovery and Resilience Plan \"will play an important role\" in this economic expansion, particularly in 2022. In addition, the end of the restrictions will also boost domestic consumption and tourism, so the contribution of external demand will also be strong.\n\n\nThanks to the alignment of all these factors, our economy will outperform the rest of Europe's. It will grow the most this year, followed by France (5.7%), and next year, ahead of Greece (6%).\n\n\n Contact: Carmen Alarcon, Managing Partner, Spain, E: \ncalarcon@taplowgroup.com\n\n\nSweden\n\n\nSweden’s economy expanded more than expected in the first quarter\n, a surprise that’s likely to silence calls for the Riksbank to cut interest rates below zero again to accelerate the recovery.\n\n\nGross domestic product grew 1.1%\n, Statistics Sweden said. Analysts polled by Bloomberg expected a 0.5% expansion, slightly below the central bank’s forecast.\n\n\n“The strong trends make a rate cut or other stimulus measures less likely,” Nordea’s economist Torbjorn Isaksson said in a report. Still, “it is not likely that inflation will be high enough for the bank to take the foot off the accelerator,” he said.\n\n\n Contact: Emma Tilson, Managing Partner, Sweden, E: \nemma.tilson@asearch.se\n\n\nUK\n\n\nThe UK economy shrank by 1.5% in the first three months of 2021\n but gathered speed in March as lockdown restrictions began to ease, official figures show. The reopening of schools and strong retail spending helped the economy grow 2.1% in March, its fastest monthly growth since last August.\n\n\nBut the economy is still 8.7% smaller than it was before the pandemic.\n However, March marked a possible turning point, economists suggested. Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, predicted the UK economy was now on course for a bumper bounce-back this year.\n\n\n\"The first quarter should mark the low point for the economy in 2021,\" said Mr Parikh. \"The lockdown and added costs of navigating new trading terms with the EU, limited many businesses' trading activities at the start of the year.\"\n\n\nOfficial trade figures\n, published at the same time as growth figures, showed a shift away from trading with EU countries since Brexit. \"Imports from Europe remained sluggish in the first three months of the year, being outstripped by non-EU imports for the first time on record,\" said ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan.\n\n\nIn the January to March quarter, the UK's exports to the EU fell 18.1% to £32.2bn, while exports to non-EU countries rose by 0.4% to £41.1bn, compared with the previous quarter.\n\n\nThe value of imports from the EU fell by 21.7% to £50.6bn, and imports from non-EU countries fell by 0.9% to £53.2bn.\n\n\n Contact: Mark Firth, Managing Partner, UK, E: \nmfirth@taplowgroup.com\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAmericas\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRegional economic activity is projected to grow by 3.7% in 2021 as pandemic mitigation measures are relaxed, a vaccine is rolled out, key commodity prices firm, and external conditions improve. \n\n\nBrazil\n\n\nRecent data from IPEA – Brazil “Institute for Applied Economic Research”, indicate a recovery trajectory of the Brazilian economy\n, mostly led by the industry and the service sectors. However, the recent aggravation of the pandemic, which imposed a strong pressure on the health system, has forced the state governments to reintroduce social distancing measures to help contention of the number of new cases of the disease.\n\n\nThe economic forecast for the second semester of 2021 contemplates an advanced vaccinal coverage against Covid 19 and a growth recovery due to consumers’ and entrepreneurs’ increase in trust and the reduction of the social distancing measures. For 2022, IPEA forecasts a GDP growth of 2.8%. Although inferior to the GDP for 2021, the 2022 GDP rate contemplates a scenario of maintenance of the recovery activity of the second semester of 2021.\n\n\nKey sectors of GDP rate for 2021 include Industry growth of 3.7%\n; Services: 2.8%, and Agribusiness: 2.8%. Conversely, same GDP components for 2022 show increase rates of: Services: 3.0%; Industry 2.5%, and Agribusiness: 2.0%.\n\n\nBrazilian grain crop estimates for 2021 reached an all times record of 264.5 million tons,\n up 4.2% vs. 2020. Main grain crop of soya beans soared to 131.8 million tons, 8.5% higher than 2020 and other crops with much lower tonnage included corn, rice, wheat, other cereals and other leguminosae. Due to the current devaluated Brazilian real currency those commodity items became attractive export opportunities for the producers, affecting the internal market supply and raise in prices this year.\n\n\nUnemployment rates are still extremely high, reaching 13.9% in the end of 2020\n and the number of unemployed workers amounted to 14.1 million, 6.17% higher than the yearly average of 13.4 million in 2020. Occupied population in the last quarter of 2020 amounted to 86.2 million, 4.5% or 3.7 million above the previous quarter\n\n\n Contact: Tácito Bocaiuva, Managing Partner, Brazil, E: \ntbocaiuva@taplowgroup.com\n\n\nUSA\n\n\nBusiness growth is widely reported as being quite robust.\n Reports from Bloomberg and from the US Labour Department suggest that front line workers are in short supply and many are not prepared to return to the workforce because low wages will not cover the cost of childcare. This will probably last until schools can broadly and safely re-open.\n\n\nTrends in the US are a bit spotty as major firms seem to be more focused below the executive level. We note the following in executive and senior professional levels:\n\n\nCorporate relocations to lower cost and less regulated states seem to be accelerating\n including businesses from Canada and other countries as well as other states\n\n\n\n\nSome of the moves seem to be spontaneous and driven in part the size of the markets in some lower cost areas such as Arizona\n\n\nCost of Living and a well-educated work force seem to be driving these announcement.\n\n\n\n\nSearch is heavily focused on adding women and minority professionals\n in almost every market and every level.\n\n\nSenior level departures slowed during the latter part of 2020\n and now appear to be accelerating with 3 notable phenomenon\n\n\n\n\nInternal promotions with women and minority professionals being appointed to executive level positions appear to be increasing\n\n\nExternal hires into executive and professional levels appear to include an unexpectedly high number of previous employees who have grown in stature and experience working for other firms and\n\n\nExecutives in firms are being solicited even if they have fairly short service in a more senior role as the hiring company has run out of promotable professionals\n\n\n\n\nAt the most senior levels we are seeing quite a few executives who have departed their recent firms and are actively soliciting Board and Trusteeship appointments.\n\n\n Contact: Steve Schrenzel, Managing Partner, USA, E: \nsschrenzel@taplowes.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (10428)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Technology is transforming the way business is now conducted. Virtual meetings from the comfort of the home have replaced formal meetings. Digital technology has impacted every sphere of life, every industry, and business. AI is allowing a machine to replicate cognitive abilities found in human beings to make tasks easier, effective, and efficient. We agree, that it has transformed the manufacturing, medical, retail, and multiple other sectors, but what about those areas that require extensive human intervention like consulting, law, or recruitment?\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence is assisting executive search consultants:\n\n\n\n\nDraw insights from trends and patterns\n\r\nArtificial Intelligence would help you to get excellent insights from past data trends and patterns. For example – the average tenure of a CTO in an organization in the retail sector is 3 years. This means that you could start reaching out to potential candidates once they have completed 2.5 years of service. Similarly, a lot of insights can be drawn from past data. What are the top qualities for CFOs? What are the top challenges that a CEO faces? Data analysis can provide the answer to all these questions.\n\n\n\n\nPredict the most suitable fit\n\n\nExecutive search services\n assisting accuracy with machine learning algorithms predicting the best-suited candidates. Technology will also aid in defining the role and job description. AI would narrow down the search and bring to you those candidates who are most suitable for the position. This saves a lot of time in the entire hiring process.\n\n\n\n\nSuggest the best compensation\n\r\nThe artificial intelligence machines and devices have data about compensations and benefits being offered for a similar role in the industry. It would help you decide on the compensation and hence gives you more information when you go into salary negotiations.\n\n\n\n\nWhy Artificial Intelligence cannot replace executive search management consulting?\n\r\nAI can aid the \n executive search services\n but can never replace executive recruitment consultants. Executive search is for C-suite, senior management, or positions that determine the strategic missions for the organizations. In many cases, even the CVs are not considered and direct interviews are scheduled. Human interaction is essential for executive search and it is the human mind that would probe beyond the roles, titles, and skills. It is the human mind that would determine the cultural and organizational fit. \n Executive search consultants\n have thorough knowledge about the industry trends, the current challenges, and opportunities and this knowledge combined with the experience would help in finding the best talent for the top managerial positions in the organization.\n\n\n\r\nThus, artificial intelligence would no doubt make the job easier for an executive recruitment consultant but can never replace the human factor in these services. The human factor would always remain the most crucial element in the search process. It is the inputs and analysis that assist a consultant. You would still need expert to interpret the trends and find the best-suited talent for the organization.\n\n\n\r\nAt The Taplow Group we not only help you source the best-fit for your organization’s leadership through our executive search consultants but also train and develop employees and your teams to hone their skills.

    "content": "April 2021 Global Business Report\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nMonday, April 19, 2021\n/\nCategories: \nNews\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nThe Taplow Group – Global Business Report - April 2021\n\n\nThe Taplow Group S.A. with 21 partner firms is located in 30 offices across 6 continents. Our expert consultants bring a wealth of expertise in their respective countries whilst effortlessly collaborating internationally. We bring you the latest economic and business information from our local partners across the world.\n\n\nAFRICA\n\n\nThe Africa Development Bank reports that Africa is projected to recover in 2021 from its worst economic recession in half a century. Economic activity in Africa was constrained in 2020 by an unprecedented global pandemic caused by COVID–19. Real GDP in Africa is projected to grow by 3.4 percent in 2021, after contracting by 2.1 percent in 2020. This projected recovery from the worst recession in more than half a century will be underpinned by a resumption of tourism, a rebound in commodity prices, and the rollback of pandemic-induced restrictions. The outlook is, however, subject to great uncertainty from both external and domestic risks.\n\n\nSouth Africa\n\n\nSouth Africa’s trade surplus rose to R28.96 billion in February 2021, exceeding expectations and bolstering the Rand. Exports grew by 16.5%, mainly due to a 73% rise in the sales of vehicles and transport equipment. Meanwhile, imports only rose by 1.6%, leading to the widening surplus. The ABSA Manufacturing PMI rose from 53 last month to 57.4 in March, exceeding an expected rise to 55. Growth in vehicle sales of over 30% also reinforced the narrative of economic recovery and an uptick in spending.\n\n\nThe central bank has also revised Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth estimates for 2021 up to 3.8%, from 3.6%. However, despite the positive local data, investor preference for major developed-market currencies has erased potential gains for emerging markets\n\n\nASIA\n\n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) says the Covid-19 pandemic has pulled the region's developing economies into recession. It is the first time in six decades that \"developing Asia\" - a designation that includes 45 countries - has seen a regional slump.\n\n\nThe ADB says developing Asia's economy shrank by 0.7% in 2020. But the region is expected to rebound strongly in 2021, growing by 6.8% next year.\n\n\nAustralia\n\n\nEconomic, health, fiscal, employment, trade and travel conditions continue to improve in Australia and the outlook is the economy is recovering from the COVID-19 crisis faster and stronger than previously expected.\n\n\nAustralia’s economy is forecasted to grow by 4.5 per cent in 2021 according to The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the economic growth is expected to reach 2.8 per cent in 2022. The IMF notes that the “Australian economy continues to show a strong recovery momentum” and that a “favourable labour market recovery continues to support a strong rebound in private consumption, added by wealth effects from rising house prices”. Australia’s GDP is “projected to reach the pre-COVID level by the March quarter 2021 and compares favourably internationally with GDP remaining “significantly below pre-pandemic trends in most countries”. Australia also continues to compare well to other nations, forecasting Japan’s economy to grow by 3.3 per cent, Germany by 3.6 per cent and Italy by 4.2 per cent.\n\n\nLabour Force numbers demonstrate the strength and resilience of Australia’s economy with 70,700 jobs created in March – with around 80% of the jobs going to women and around half to young people and the participation rate has also risen to a record high. The labour market having recovered more than four times faster than during the 90s recession.\n\n\nExports to China hit a record in the first three months of the year as strong demand for iron ore continues with the total value of goods exports from Australia rising 20.7 per cent in the first quarter of the year, according to data released by China’s customs ¬agency and China’s exports to Australia for the three months to the end of March were up 50.5 per cent. The new trade numbers show the deep complementarity between resource-rich Australia and China, its biggest trading partner.\n\n\nChina\n\n\nChina’s economic surged by 18.3 percent in the first quarter According to the National Bureau of Statistics, China's economy grew by 18.3 percent in the first quarter of 2021 and in the steady process of recovery. The Chinese economy \"made a good start\" in the first quarter with expanded demand and enhanced market vitality. However, there are multiple unstable factors still needs to be faced including external uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 and international environment as well as domestic long-standing structural issues and new problems.\n\n\nChinese regulators imposed $2.8 billion fine in an anti-monopoly investigation of Alibaba Alibaba was charged by the State Administration for Market Regulation with abusing its market dominance. The fine was equivalent to four percent of Alibaba's domestic sales in 2019. \"Alibaba accepts the penalty with sincerity and will ensure its compliance with determination,\" The announcement is the latest development in the government's increased oversight on internet companies to avoid the \"disorderly expansion of capital\".\n\n\nRetail sales growth improved in March Retail sales growth rose to 34.2% in March, against market expectations of a fall. Thanks for the domestic containment of Covid-19 and the gradual relaxation of some social distancing rules, a faster consumption recovery was driven partly by the release of pent-up demand. It is expected the retail sales, especially catering services will remain solid in coming months.\n\n\nIndia\n\n\nGlobal brokerage Nomura lowered its growth expectations for India to 12.6% in the new fiscal year from 13.5% earlier. The revision reflected the pandemic drag on the economy and marginally lower retail inflation. At the beginning of the month, Nomura had warned that the economy’s growth could fall to 12.2% if the second wave of Covid-19 worsened.\n\n\nIndia has become the fastest country in the world to administer 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine. India achieved the feat in 85 days whereas USA took 89 days and China reached the milestone in 102 days.\n\n\nJapanese electronics brand AIWA, which registered its India subsidiary in February this year, is relaunching with five products in TWS and audio segment at a total investment outlay of $10 million for phase-1 of operations. It is also looking to establish a manufacturing base in India by direct investment in Greenfield projects as well as partnering with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the second phase.\n\n\nThe government recently approved the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for Air-Conditioners and LED Lighting with a budgetary outlay of $1 Billion. The white goods industry welcomed the government’s scheme for these products and feel it will promote production of both finished goods and components.\n\n\nThe pandemic has pushed India’s passenger vehicle sales to six-year low. According to the data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), passenger vehicle wholesales declined by 2.24% in FY 2020-21.\n\n\nIndia is offering more than $1 billion in cash to each semi-conductor company that sets up manufacturing units in the country as it seeks to build on its smartphone assembly industry and strengthen its electronics supply chain.\n\n\nSingapore\n\n\nSingapore’s economy grew by 0.2 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2021, a turnaround after three quarters of contraction, as the country continued its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Making the most gains in the first quarter was the manufacturing sector, which grew 7.5 per cent year-on-year. Accounting for about one-fifth of Singapore’s economy, the sector has been a bright spot in the pandemic-fuelled downturn. This is largely due to growth in clusters such as precision engineering, biomedical manufacturing, and electronics, which have benefited from the boom in electronics demand as businesses look to digital solutions in a post-COVID world. (Source: Channel News Asia)\n\n\nSingapore and Hong Kong are in discussion on starting the long-delayed air travel bubble between the two cities. The air travel bubble between Hong Kong and Singapore was originally scheduled to begin in November last year but was deferred due to a spike in infections in Hong Kong. The scheme would have allowed people to travel between the two cities with no restrictions on the purpose of travel and no requirement for a controlled itinerary or sponsorship. Travellers would be subject only to COVID-19 tests, without the need for quarantine or stay-home notices. (Source: Channel News Asia)\n\n\nNew Zealand\n\n\nThe latest NZIER Quarterly Survey of Business Opinion shows a modest improvement in business confidence in the first quarter of 2021, while demand held steady.\n\n\nA net 11 percent of businesses expect a worsening in general economic conditions over the coming months, on a seasonally adjusted basis. This is a modest improvement from the 16 percent of businesses which were pessimistic about the economic outlook in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, firms’ own trading activity was unchanged from the previous quarter. This measure suggests annual GDP growth will track around 2 percent in the March 2021 quarter.\n\n\nRetailers most pessimistic of the sectors surveyed\n The retail sector has become the most downbeat of the sectors surveyed, with a net 38 percent expecting a deterioration in the economic outlook. Although retailers report some softening in demand, the significant development has been the surge in costs in the retail sector. This is likely to reflect the effects of COVID-related supply chain disruptions, which are driving up shipping and freight costs and affecting retailers’ ability to restock shelves. The building sector has also become more downbeat, despite a still solid pipeline of construction. Supply chain disruptions also look to be affecting activity, along with an acute shortage of skilled labour. Building construction firms report difficulty in finding skilled labour at levels last seen in mid-2017.\n\n\nCost pressures remain intense\n Supply chain disruptions are contributing to the intense cost pressures across most sectors. However, firms are also finding it easier to pass on higher costs by raising prices. A net 8 percent of firms raised prices in the March quarter – a turnaround from the net 2 percent which cut prices in the previous quarter. Higher export-oriented dairy and fruit prices are supporting key regions. These results suggest a pick-up in inflation pressures over the coming year.\n\n\nFirms positive about hiring and investment\n Despite some uncertainty about the economic outlook, firms are continuing to plan for an increase in staff numbers and investment. A net 8 percent of firms increased staff numbers in the March quarter, and a net 18 percent plan to hire in the next quarter. Firms are also feeling more confident about investment, particularly in plant and machinery. Rising labour costs and the reduced ability of firms to bring in workers from overseas given border restrictions has likely sharpened the focus on investment in labor-saving technology.\n\n\nTravel bubble with Australia announced\n The New Zealand Government announced the confirmation last week of a ‘travel bubble’ with Australia. Economists state that this will be a welcome development for some local businesses, but the net impact on GDP is likely to be muted as we see a bounce in both inflows and outflows of tourist spending. A wider reopening of the borders, and a more complete rebound in activity, is not likely to happen until next year, once the Covid-19 vaccination programme is substantially completed.\n\n\nEUROPE\n\n\nThe eurozone economy grew at a record pace in the third quarter of 2020 but has already stalled in the face of a resurgence of coronavirus infections and tough new restrictions, leaving Europe lagging behind the U.S. and Asia in its recovery from the crisis.\n\n\nThe EU Commission reports that overall, GDP is now forecast to grow by 3.7% in 2021 and 3.9% in 2022 in the EU, and by 3.8% in both years in the euro area. The EU economy would reach the pre-crisis level of output earlier than anticipated back in the Autumn Forecast, largely because of the stronger momentum in the second half of 2021 and in 2022. The speed of the recovery will, however, vary significantly across the EU.\n\n\nFrance\n\n\nThe Banque de France estimates that the loss of GDP in March was -4% compared to the pre-crisis level, compared to -5% in February. For the first quarter as a whole, GDP is expected to grow slightly compared to the previous quarter.\n\n\nIn March, sanitary measures were gradually extended, with in particular the implementation of reinforced restrictions in 16 and then 19 departments from March 20. Nevertheless, activity strengthened in industry, as well as in market services and construction, according to the Banque de France business survey conducted between March 29 and April 6 among 8,500 companies.\n\n\nIn industry, activity continued to recover in March. The production capacity utilization rate increased by three points to 80%, returning to a level comparable to that of the pre-crisis period (it was 79% in February). It has improved in all sectors, with particularly significant increases in the automotive sector (from 75% to 80%), in the clothing, textiles and footwear sector (from 74% to 79%) and in the rubber and plastic products sector (from 78% to 83%).\n\n\nThe capacity utilization rate is fairly uniform across sectors and is above 79% in all sectors, with the exception of aeronautics and other transport and metallurgy, where it remains down (71% and 77% respectively).\n\n\nBusiness leaders believe that activity has returned to near pre-crisis levels in sectors such as food processing and rubber and plastics manufacturing. In contrast, activity is only three-quarters of its pre-crisis level in the aeronautics and other transport sectors. As in February, and to an even greater extent, industrial business leaders reported an increase in raw material and finished product prices in March.\n\n\nIn market services, activity is improving in most sectors. On one hand, this trend is particularly noticeable in transportation services, information services and certain business services such as legal and accounting activities and management consulting. On the other hand, activity remains very weak in accommodation and catering. Business activity is increasing in the construction sector and has reached a level close to that of the pre-crisis period, according to the business leaders questioned.\n\n\nIn April, taking into account the reinforcement of sanitary measures (extension of restrictions to the whole country, closure of day-care centres and schools for three to four weeks), the Banque de France estimates that the loss of GDP compared to the pre-crisis level would be -7%, i.e. of the same order of magnitude as during the previous lockdown in November (but during which day-care centres and schools remained open), and four to five times lower than during the first lockdown in April 2020. This indicates an increased resilience of the economy to health constraints.\n\n\nIn industry, activity would be almost stable overall. The clothing, textile and footwear sector is expected to show a marked decline, while activity in the chemical industry is expected to increase. Production in the aeronautics and other transport sector is also expected to rise, but to remain well below its pre-crisis level.\n\n\nThe services sector would see a particularly marked deterioration in automotive repair and in equipment and automobile rental. Activity should also deteriorate in the personal services sector, as well as in accommodation, where it is already at an exceptionally low level. Finally, activity in the construction sector is expected to show little change.\n\n\nFinland\n\n\nMunicipal election takes place in June seeing strong growth from a right-wing party True Finns who are competing with Social Democrats about the biggest party.\n\n\nOn country level there is strong focus on sustainable growth and recovery plan, leading the finance towards green transition and digitalization.\n\n\nRecruitment business is continuing to recover in Finland with a strong Q1. Companies are recruiting now more and investing also to new roles and businesses. Startup scene is still strong in Finland, especially in tech sector.\n\n\nFinnish forest industry company Metsä Group is making a biggest investment in Finnish forest industry when they build a new pulp factory in Northern Finland, worth 1.6B€\n\n\nGermany\n\n\nThe partial lockdown is still in place with selective openings and different rules depending on states and regions; schools are open only for youngest ones and last-year pupils. A draft of a new federal lockdown law with more restrictions is disputed in parliament; the federal lockdown-easing matrix with multiple steps to open or close was implemented differently in the states.\n\n\nCovid-infections increase and cause fear of future shortages in hospitals. People increase lockdown complaints. Most work should and is performed from home. Government recovery schemes spending continue.\n\n\nIn general, many residents hope and wait for better times to come. Most production sectors grow from exports only, consumer spending for non-food remains low, some consumer may lack money to spend while others may save it; entertainment, hospitality and passenger transportation suffer; financial services sectors perform well but some fear adjustable assets in their books, some firms grow while performing strong cost reductions. Healthcare, software, technology, telecommunications, energy and agriculture are relatively unaffected. Food and online delivery and many essentials perform well, most logistic business is performing very well.\n\n\nCovid-test rates are still small but increase. Vaccination rate is too slow like in other major EU countries and can cost lots of billions of Euros in business. An expectation is federal elections this September shall ensure vaccination offers to all, many are uncertain. Though GDP decline in 2020 was lower than expected and lower than in other EU countries published expected growth rates for 2021 and 2022 were reduced again.\n\n\nSpain\n\n\nSpain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez on Tuesday guaranteed that the biggest public investment plan in recent history (€140bn) will modernize the Spanish economy more intensely than at any other time since the country joined the European Union in 1986 Around half of the amount, €72 billion, will take the form of grants, while the rest € 70 will be paid out in loans. Over the next six years, Pedro Sánchez said, Spain will undertake 102 reforms (labour, pensions, taxes, public administration etc) and 110 substantial investment projects (mobility strategy, residential building renovation plan, digitalization, tourism, 5G and technologies).\n\n\nWe expect a recovery specially in tourism, as the Canary Island and Baleares will receive a big stake of this funds. Also, the vaccine program is going under schedule and the state of alarm will end the 9th of May.\n\n\nAnd the show goes on in Madrid as cultural life continues despite pandemic: opera house and museums remain open\n\n\nUK\n\n\nThe latest UK economic data has been significantly better than economists expected, suggesting households and companies have been more resilient to the latest lockdown and Britain will climb international economic performance league tables in the months ahead.\n\n\nBritain’s recovery during the second half of last year was stronger than first estimated, according to official figures that also showed that households put away more money in savings accounts than previous data suggested.\n\n\nIn a series of revisions to its data covering the Covid-19 pandemic, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy expanded by 16.9% and 1.3% in the third and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively. This marked steep increases on initial estimates of 16.1% and 1%.\n\n\nAnalysts said the more robust recovery than first pencilled in by the ONS gave hope for a broader expansion during 2021 as the economy gained momentum. Business surveys from the Institute for Directors (IoD) and the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) showed that most small and medium-sized business owners expected growth to accelerate during the year as consumers returned to high streets and face-to-face contact resumed.\n\n\nThe IoD said businesses were beginning to hire more staff after optimism increased to its highest level since the 2019 general election. It added that difficulties with new trading terms with the EU was “a top factor having a negative impact on business”.\n\n\nAMERICAS\n\n\nAccording to the most recent forecast released at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, U.S. GDP growth is expected to contract by 2.4% in 2020. It is estimated to then rebound up to a 4.2% growth rate in 2021, and slow to 3.2% in 2022, and 2.4% in 2023.\n\n\nFour years! That is how long it will take Latin America and the Caribbean to recover pre-pandemic economic growth, says the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) in its 2021 preliminary overview report.\n\n\nGrowth in 2021 is expected to reach 3.7 percent, due mostly to a statistical rebound after, in 2020, contracting 7.7 percent to mark the deepest recession among the world’s emerging economic regions. The World Bank also arrived at 3.7 percent growth in its 2021 growth projection for the region, followed by 2.8 percent in 2022.\n\n\nBrazil\n\n\nIn 2020, due to the adversities brought by Covid-19, the GDP fell 4.1% against 2019, the lowest rate of the timeline series started in 1966 (former estimates indicated a – 9.00%+ rate). In the cumulative yearly rate, GDP, in current values, amounted to US$ 1,443 trillion out of which US$ 1,241 trillion refers to Value Added at basic prices and US$ 193,9 billion to Net Taxes on Products.\n\n\nThere was an increase only in Agriculture of 2.0% and decreases in Industry of -3.5% and Services -4.5%. The GDP totalled US$ 1,443 trillion, in 2020. The Investment Rate in 2020 was 16.4% of GDP vs. 15.4% in 2019, and the Savings Rate was 15% vs. 12.5% in 2019. The Per Capita GDP reached US$ 6,822 in 2020, down 4.8% in real terms. This was also the lowest rate in the timeline series. Source: IBGE/” Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics” – Brazilian Government\n\n\nUSA\n\n\nThe U.S. economy has roared back to life in 2021, with first-quarter growth set to defy even the rosiest expectations as another fresh influx of cash looms.\n\n\nManufacturing data Monday showed the sector at its highest growth level since August 2018. That report from the Institute for Supply Management in turn helped confirm the notion among economists that output to start the year is far better than the low single-digit growth many had been predicting in late 2020.\n\n\nThe Atlanta Federal Reserve, which tracks data in real time to estimate changes in gross domestic product, now is indicating a 10% gain for the first three months of the year. The GDPNow tool generally is volatile early in the quarter then becomes more accurate as the data rolls in through the period.\n\n\nThat comes on the heels of a report Friday showing that personal income surged 10% in January, thanks largely to $600 stimulus checks from the government. Household wealth increased nearly $2 trillion for the month while spending rose just 2.4%, or $340.9 billion.\n\n\nThose numbers, along with a burst of nearly $4 trillion in savings, pointed to an economy not only growing powerfully but also one that is poised to continue that path through the year.\n\n\n“The V-shaped recovery in real GDP will remain V-shaped during the first half of this year and probably through the end of the year,” Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research wrote in his daily note last Tuesday.\n\n\nWe hope that you, your family, and work colleagues continue to stay healthy and safe. We at The Taplow Group are here to support you and your company through this crisis and beyond. We will be back with another set of updates soon.

Planning the hiring process, interviewing candidates, finding cultural compatibility, and getting the person aligned with the organization’s vision and mission is indeed a big challenge for the human resources department. A bad hire could cost you in terms of time and money, sometimes even making the difference between making a profit or going down the wrong road. Hence, the solution is to look inwards, start with ensuring you seek internal candidates and develop leaders from within with the help of our world-class \n leadership development management services.\n\n\n\n\nWhy should organizations look for internal candidates?\n\n\n\n\nSaving on Time and Money\n\r\nThere is nothing called a free lunch in the world of business. A hiring process comes at a cost. At the same time, it could save a lot of time for the organsation. When you look internally, whilst assessing the external talent, you save time on the background verification or induction of the candidate. That’s why you must nurture the leaders of tomorrow by proper training interventions conducted by a leadership development management services firm.\n\n\n\n\nIncreases Productivity\n\r\nIf your employees are aware of the process of internal promotions, then they would give their best effort at work and take ownership of their activities. Alongside that, they would also be closely aligned with the organization’s culture, policies, and business procedures. That would make the candidate more productive as compared to someone completely new into the organization.\n\n\n\n\nReduce Attrition\n\r\nRewarding your employees and promoting them gives them a sense of belonging and loyalty to the organization. This would in turn reduce attrition as your employees would be encouraged to stay in the organization. When you indulge your workforce in leadership development coaching activities they find more and more reasons to stick with your organization. You show your employees the path towards growth and development and they will continue to raise the flag of the organization.\n\n\n\n\n Succession Planning\n\r\nA major benefit of internal hiring that is often overlooked is that it facilities succession planning within the organization. Very few organizations have a proper succession plan in place and an internal hiring strategy would encourage the organization to look into succession planning proactively. You will ensure that your employees are properly trained and groomed as they move into higher positions of responsibility. This means that it is highly likely that the new candidate will excel in no time in the new position. It would help you close the gap in a shorter period.\n\n\n\r\nHence, with proper training interventions from \n leadership development management services\n firms, your organization can have an excellent internal hiring policy in place. You already have access to superior talent within the organization, ready to take the challenge to the next level. There are multiple benefits of internal hiring right from saving on time and money to increasing productivity and morale. Look internally and nurture your future leaders today!\n\n\n\r\nAt The Taplow Group we not only help you source the best-fit for your organization’s leadership through our \nexecutive search consultants\n but also train and develop employees and your teams to hone their skills.

It may be an intangible asset but has a huge bearing on the profitability of an organization and organizations need to invest and focus on activities like learning and development initiatives, health and well-being programs, and specialized skills development that are beneficial for both the individual employee as well as the organization.\nOrganizations invest in human capital to gain competitive advantage. Do you know that organizations that leverage their human capital to achieve their business goals are usually more profitable?\nFor example, if an organization is working on an expansion plan, it would need additional workforce at various levels. In order for the plan to go as formulated, right people must be hired at the right time and that’s exactly where a human resource consulting firm fits in. By taking care of the entire process, right from sourcing to final onboarding, a \n human capital search firm\n will find you the talent you seek to make your plans work like a dream. On the other hand, failing to meet your hiring needs at the right time could derail the entire plan which could lead to huge losses.\nHaving the right people in the right roles is important in order to achieve operational goals of quality, quantity and efficiency.

Hire Your Next CEO With Our CEO Search Services\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nWednesday, March 31, 2021\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat would you like your next CEO to be? A disruptor or an enabler? The ideal answer should be both at the same time, resulting in more agility in this fast-paced business world. Whether the role of a CEO has become abruptly vacant, or an opening came due to retirement, you need the best CEO search services to fulfill the position on time. Our \n CEO recruiters\n believe that appointing the CEO is just one step in the entire journey and hence we start by defining the Agile Leader.\nAgility is a highly priced attribute. With the pace at which technology is evolving and transforming the way business is conducted, every leader has a bare minimum time to think and respond to these changes. In this uncertain and dynamic landscape, your CEO needs to be ready for unexpected situations, make quick decisions with accuracy, and keep the organization on-track for its future success. In other words, the CEO needs to be extremely Agile. Being agile means being an enabler and disruptor at the same time.\nThrough our \n CEO search services\n, we look for leaders who can connect with people and make things happen at the same time disrupting the existing processes, pushing their employees to take that extra mile.\nWhat do an enabler and disruptor look like?\nThe primary role of an enabler is to communicate clearly with the workforce. Every employee must be aligned with the vision and mission of the organization. The leader must work towards enabling fellow associates, collaborate effectively, and encourage others to grow and thrive. On the other hand, disruptors tend to replace old processes with the customer-aligned process i.e. they question the status quo and often take confident and bold decisions. These leaders encourage digital literacy in the team and have a clear understanding of the current customer landscape. When you combine these two traits together, you get a truly agile leader.\nIf you want your next CEO to be a perfect blend of an enabler and a disruptor, then partner with our CEO search services. We have worked with organizations across multiple industries and sizes. Our CEO consultants have in-depth knowledge and expertise about the current trends in the market. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive CEO recruitment and succession plan. The CEO recruiters will align the team with the new CEO, take care of the necessary \n CEO certification\n, and make sure that the onboarding is as smooth as possible.\nOur satisfied customers bear testimony to the result-driven processes we follow. Our consultants are extremely dedicated and professional individuals. They know how to tap the right talent in the market, even though other firms would fail to spot them. \n Our CEO search services\n start from aligning the stakeholders with the new transformation. Then we prepare the job roles and responsibilities. In the next part, we provide a small list of genuine candidates for interviews. Finally, after a series of interviews and discussions, we ensure to on-board the best candidate as your next CEO.

On the other hand, a good CEO is someone who can juggle many key responsibilities while still becoming a trusted and respected decision-maker by others, specifically his or her peers and employees. To do this and keep it up, you'll need to have or develop those intangible qualities. We at The Taplow Group believe that a leader must be perfect to settle in the eyes of \n ceo recruiters\n, and below are just a few responsibilities that a company leader should conquer.\n\n\n\n\nA Lesson Learnt\n\r\nA CEO must learn from previous mistakes and apply what he or she has learned to the future. CEOs, like everyone else, are fallible. Errors can occur, but a CEO must learn from them to avoid them in the future. Suppose a CEO, for example, did not have an efficient crisis management system in place before a situation arose. In that case, they could understand what they need for future reference and formulate a strategy based on what went wrong the first time.\n\n\n\n\nSocialize \n\r\nCEOs must be able to communicate effectively as a leader. In any situation, communication is crucial, and as someone in charge, a CEO must learn how to communicate effectively to increase morale when necessary. A CEO must be able to articulate what they need, who they need it from, who they need it by, and how things should be done, from inspiring their team to finishing projects on time. \"Top executives are constantly honest and balanced in their communication,\" according to a study on Developing Exceptional Executives by \nvarious ceo search services\n. They use short, direct, and easily understandable language to efficiently communicate their views on business potential and problems and expectations for action in easily digestible doses. They invest time in their relationships.\"\n\n\n\n\nComprehensive\n\r\nA CEO must be aware of issues both within and outside the workplace. Employees are individuals with lives outside of work, and if an emergency arises, various \nGlobal Executive Search services\n are in constant hunt for a CEO who must deliver sympathetic and delegate responsibility to the employee. When an employee is working and focusing on other matters, the likelihood of making a mistake is much higher. A CEO must also recognize that things happen that are beyond his or her control. In advertising, they will change their minds at any moment. A CEO must comprehend and approve the situation to act appropriately.\n\n\n\n\nVisionary \n\r\nWhile it may appear to be self-evident, the market evolves. It's critical to think outside the box because there are always more effective ways to accomplish business objectives. The same tried and proper processes may not always work. When a CEO considers outside the box, it distinguishes them and their business from competitors. Other factors, such as experience, contribute to a good CEO's credentials, but these fundamental characteristics will keep you ahead of the curve. If you lack in any of these areas, investing in a business mentor, learning from other executives, or exploring personal improvement skills are all excellent ways to develop personally and professionally.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (4321)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "The Taplow Group – Global Business Report - March 2021\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nTuesday, March 16, 2021\n/\nCategories: \nNews\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Taplow Group – Global Business Report - March 2021\n\n\nThe Taplow Group S.A. with 21 partner firms has its presence vai our 30 offices across 6 continents. Our expert consultants not only bring a wealth of expertise in their respective countries but also internationally. We have put together this report to bring business leaders the global economic and business information.\n\n\nAFRICA\n\n\nAfrica’s economic outlook continues to brighten. Its real GDP growth, is projected to accelerate to 3.9 percent in 2020 and to 4.1 percent in 2021. Leading the way are six economies among the world’s 10 fastest growers: Rwanda, Ethiopia, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Tanzania, and Benin. Growth’s fundamentals are also improving, with a gradual shift from private consumption toward investment and exports. And for the first time in a decade, investment accounted for more than half the continent’s growth, with private consumption accounting for less than one third.\n\n\nSouth Africa\n\n\nThe economy grew by 1.5% in the fourth quarter, giving an annualised growth rate of 6.3%. This follows the revised 13.7% (annualised: 67.3%) rise in economic activity recorded in the third quarter.\n\n\nEight of the ten industries made positive gains in the fourth quarter, most notably manufacturing (bolstered by increased production in food, beverages, and motor vehicles) and trade (driven by retail, motor trade, catering and accommodation). Mining and finance, real estate and business services were the two industries that recorded a decline in economic activity.\n\n\nASIA\n\n\nInvestment weekly reports that China will be a key driver of global growth in 2021. China’s firm handle on the coronavirus puts it in an enviable position compared to its peers. Japan is looking to \"Sugenomics\" to jumpstart its sluggish economy, while the central bank has already exhausted many policy options. Within Emerging Asia, the recovery is likely to be more muted in 2021 as it enters a more mechanical phase.\n\n\nOther parts of Emerging Asia are facing political risks that could impede growth. However, Vietnam is a bright spot, with positive growth likely given its success containing the virus and position as a beneficiary of US-China trade tensions.\n\n\nAustralia\n\n\nThe Australian National Accounts released on the 3rd of March 2021 show the Australian economy is strengthening and the Commonwealth Government COVID-19 economic recovery plan is working.\n\n\nIt has been underpinned by strong export receipts and that Australia has maintained its AAA credit rating. Real GDP increased in the December quarter by 3.1%. The forecast was for an increase of only 2.5% and is consistent with the growth in the previous quarter of over 3%.\n\n\nIn 2020 the Australian economy contracted 2.5% comparing favourably against the USA 3.3%, Japan 4.8%, and Italy 8.9%.\n\n\nThe national rollout of vaccine for COVID-19 is underway and it is forecasted to get the great majority of the Australian population covered by September 2021. Australia is also going to provide vaccine for Pacific nations. As 2021 progresses the Commonwealth, State and territory governments will reduce the emergency and direct economic support.\n\n\nSigns are positive however with 320,000 new jobs and 2.1 million Australian workers coming off employment support benefits, and with 94% of the 1.3 million Australians who lost their jobs or saw their working hours reduced to zero, now back at work.\n\n\n(Sources include the Australian National Accounts and the Federal Treasurer.)\n\n\nChina\n\n\nGDP growth target at “above 6%\n\n\nChina targeted its GDP growth this year at “above 6%” in the annual National People’s Congress (NPC) session. China also committed to make “no sharp turns” on its monetary policy stance. Market interpreted the “above 6%” growth target as too conservative because China will avoid pushing the growth target in 2022.\n\n\nCPI inflation target lowered to ~3.0%\n\n\nThe official CPI inflation target was set at “~3.0%” for 2021, lower than “~3.5%” for 2020. The market assumes a gradual and moderate policy may be implemented in 2021.\n\n\nSlightly higher job market targets\n\n\nThe target for new urban employment in 2021 was set at over 11million people. It is a good sign for job market. But it also raised the concern about the real unemployment rate impacted by the COVID-19 in 2021.\n\n\nSome longer-term plan issued\n\n\nChina vowed to cut energy use per unit of GDP by 13.5% and reduce CO2 emissions per unit of GDP by 18% by 2025. New energy industry could benefit from this plan. China also adopted some favorable policies to encourage the development of high technology manufacturing sector. Talent demands in high technology manufacturing is booming.\n\n\nIndia\n\n\nRating agency Moody has upped India's growth projection for the financial year beginning 1st April, to 13.7% from 10.8% that was estimated earlier. The revised numbers came on the back of normalisation of activity and growing confidence in the market with the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines.\n\n\nCOVID-19 has provided a stimulus to India's ecommerce market and is expected to touch $111 billion as per a report by financial technology firm FIS.\n\n\nGermany’s Volkswagen group has started to pump in fresh investments to the tune of nearly $1 Billion for an India fightback and group company Skoda that will lead the charge will launch four new cars in the market.\n\n\nApple will start manufacturing iPhone 12 in India this year. The Indian government has reportedly approved a proposal of about $1 billion to push local manufacturing, including cashback of 1% to 4% to manufacturers.\n\n\nOla plans to invest $2 billion in a two-wheeler factory in Tamil Nadu. The Future Factory will be able to produce 10 million electric scooters per year. The cement industry is set to hit a decadal high-volume growth of 13% in the next fiscal, helped by an expected revival in demand from the infrastructure and urban housing sectors, according to CRISIL ratings.\n\n\nFDI in 2021 may be more than 2020. Experts largely feel the sectors which can attract more FDI could be Services, IT, Telecom, and Chemicals. Apart from that, Pharma and Automobile segment can also attract flow.\n\n\nSingapore\n\n\nEconomists have upgraded their forecasts for Singapore's gross domestic product and is expected to increase 5.8 per cent this year, according to the median forecast of 24 economists surveyed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). This is in anticipation of improvements in the manufacturing and finance sectors in 2021.\n\n\nIndonesia hopes that the Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT), signed in Oct 2018 with Singapore could potentially boost two-way investment between 18 per cent to 22 per cent over the next five years. According to the Indonesian Investment Coordinating Board, Singapore was Indonesia’s largest foreign investor last year, with a total investment worth US$9.8 billion. This figure was a significant increase from the year before when Singapore’s investment in the country was US$6.5 billion.\n\n\nSingaporean companies have been among the first to invest in the Kendal Industrial Park (KIP) in Indonesia’s Central Java province. Since the park opened in 2016, more than 60 companies have set up their operations in the special economic zone, pumping in US$1.73 billion worth of investment and creating 9,000 jobs.\n\n\nAside from KIP, Nongsa Digital Park has also served as a digital bridge for tech companies from both Singapore and Indonesia. Since its launch in 2018, the digital park has grown from a handful of companies and employees to more than 150 companies and startups today.\n\n\nNew Zealand\n\n\nOne of the key sectors that has helped to bolster New Zealand’s economic fortunes in the wake of the outbreak has been the agricultural sector. The latest dairy auction is a good example. Prices rose 15% at the early March event, which saw prices 39% above year earlier levels. Strong demand (including from China) is bumping up against limited supply resulting in rapid price escalation. While the extent of this lift is unlikely to be sustained in the medium term, Economists suspect a fair amount will be on for a while yet. It will flow through to higher incomes domestically.\n\n\nInternational visitor flows fell to near zero after the New Zealand borders closed in March last year. This was always going to have a big impact on the New Zealand tourism industry (our biggest sector). Visitor arrival numbers in December were down 99% compared to a year earlier. According to the latest data, spending in Q4 2020 was around $1.3b. This is down two thirds on the same quarter a year earlier. Economist’s estimate that international visitor expenditure in the year to March 2021 will be around $5.8b. This would be nearly $10b lower than a year earlier.\n\n\nNew Zealanders’ spending offshore slumped around 80% compared to prior year levels after the borders closed. This decline resulted in a material support to domestic spending through Q2 and Q3 2020 as New Zealander’s who might have gone offshore at this time of year stayed put and spent money at home be it on travel or purchasing other items or investing in property or undertaking renovations.\n\n\nThe other key area where significant strength is occurring is the construction sector, with strength in new home building. Residential construction levels are already around 5% above the levels seen prior to the outbreak of Covid, and the outlook for the coming year is looking increasingly strong.\n\n\nEUROPE\n\n\nThe European Union consumer confidence survey in February 2021, the DG ECFIN estimate of the consumer confidence indicator picked up in both the EU (0.8 points up) and the euro area (0.7 points up) compared to January 2021. At −15.7 points (EU) and −14.8 points (euro area), the indicator continues scoring well below its long-term average of −10.6 (EU) and −11.1 (euro area).\n\n\nFrance\n\n\nThe French gross domestic product (GDP) should be \"slightly up in the first quarter compared to the previous quarter\", but the level of activity would remain 5% below its pre-crisis level in February and March, the Banque de France estimates. \"Sectors not directly exposed to sanitary measures show an activity close to normal\" while the others \"maintain a high level of loss\", specifies the central bank in its economic note.\n\n\nThe level of activity has thus reached 95% of the pre-crisis level, i.e., that of February 2020, since December. This level was 69% in April 2020, before rising to 97% in August, September, and October. The Banque de France specifies that its \"forecast for the month of March remains surrounded by a large margin of uncertainty\" linked to the progress of the vaccination campaign on the one hand, and of the coronavirus variants on the other. Its projections are based on its survey of 8,500 businesses conducted between 24 February and 3 March, but also on bank card spending, which \"remained broadly stable over January and February\".\n\n\nThe capacity utilisation rate in industry increased by one point in February, to 76%, compared to 79% before the crisis. But it is still \"particularly low in the aeronautics and other transport sector\" at 67%, while the chemical industry is \"operating close to normal\", according to the business report. The services sector \"is registered overall in very slight progression, whereas the heads of companies rather anticipated a fall last month\", still notes the Banque de France. If it remains at an extremely low level in the hotel and catering industry, activity \"is returning to normal or approaching it\" in publishing and \"business services such as legal and accounting activities or consulting services\". Finally, in construction, \"activity increased slightly in February and is close to its pre-crisis level\".\n\n\nFor 2021, the Banque de France has been forecasting 5% growth in the French economy since December. In the fourth quarter OF 2020 temporary work, the true compass of the employment market, continued to recover: +5.1% (+36,700 jobs) after +22.9% and +22.8% in the second and third quarters. But this does not compensate for the historic fall in the first quarter (-40.3%). Temporary employment at the end of 2020 therefore remains below its level at the end of 2019 (-5.3%, or -41,900 jobs).\n\n\nGermany\n\n\nThe partial lockdown is still in place with different openings more or less depending on thresholds and on states and regions – schools will open only for youngest ones and last-year pupils. A lockdown-easing matrix with multiple steps to open or close is communicated countrywide. The daily increase of Covid-infections is accelerating again. People including business stakeholders increase lockdown complaints. Most work is performed from home. Government recovery schemes spending continue.\n\n\nFinancial Services sector remain solid. There may be adjustable assets in the books; some businesses grow with cost reductions. In retail only food and online perform well. Other sectors still vary, production sectors see small increases and business drivers are digitalization and robotics, also automation, automotive, machinery and plant engineering especially for environment topics. Most of the logistic business is performing at nearly 100% of capacity rates.\n\n\nCovid-test rates are still small but expected to increase soon. Vaccination rate is slow like in some other major EU countries, and this may cost lots of billions of Euros in business. The expectation is federal elections this September shall ensure vaccination offers to these two–thirds that want it, maybe earlier but recently messages of delays are communicated again.\n\n\nSome enthusiasts still expect full economy recovery next year, some predict 2023, although the downturn of the BIP 2020 had been corrected to -4.9 % by the ministry for economics.\n\n\nCOVID-19 is disproportionately affecting female workers across Europe:\n\r\n70% of healthcare sector employees are women. Women working in healthcare are suffering from major stress (long hours under hard conditions; greater exposure to virus, leading to mental health issues).\n\n\n40% of all employed women work in hard-hit sectors (accommodation, arts and entertainment, food and beverages, garment manufacturing, retail). Women shoulder an unfair share of increased care burden. Women provide >75% of all unpaid care work, 78% of single parents are women, 10.6% of women (vs. 6.7% of men) say family responsibilities make it harder to do their jobs, and 72% of domestic workers risk losing their jobs.\n\n\nThe pandemic is expected to delay gender equality in the EU workplace by at least seven years.\n\n\nSource: Eurofound; European Commission; European Institute for Gender Equality; ILO; Kearney; OECD\n\n\nSpain\n\n\nThe Spanish economy will rebound this year by seven tenths of a percentage point more than forecast then (5% to 5.7%) and by eight tenths of a percentage point more in 2022 (4.8% compared to 4% previously), according to figures published recently by the OECD.\n\n\nOne of the reasons for the upward revision of the Spanish forecast is that \"there have been fewer mobility restrictions and Spain has coped better with the health situation\" in recent times, OECD chief economist Laurence Boone said at the report's launch in Paris\n\n\nThe upward revision for Spain is the largest among the four economies analysed in the eurozone - Germany, France, Italy and Spain - in 2021, but falls short of the projected improvement for the G20 countries (up 1.5 percentage points to 6.2%) and for the world as a whole (up 1.4 points to 5.6%). At best, Spain will return to pre-pandemic levels in the course of 2023.\n\n\nThe Private Equity Business is growing fast; especially those firms that specialize in middle market and in Special/Turnaround situations. Also, the construction sector is growing again, overseas, followed by manufacturing logistics and digital companies.\n\n\nNorway\n\n\nUnemployment is 203.000 people (registered) 7,3%, being the highest since world war II. GNP of last 12 months vary from down 5,5% to down 6,7 %. Variation is due to who is calculating. Official numbers for Norway for 2020 are expected early April.\n\n\n \n\n\nFolio rate from Bank of Norway has been 0 percent for the past 10 months. Economists expect this rate to be increased 1 or 2 times in 2021, and further in 2022. These signals in the past 2-3 weeks have resulted in strengthening the Norwegian currency; NOK (kroner)\n\n\nDespite low interest rate Norwegians have recorded high private savings in banks. These savings are a direct result of reduced ability to travel and activity in cultural events, as well as fine dining. Some industries are doing well like sporting- and outdoors goods, refurbishing of own property (kitchen, paint etc.)\n\n\nAlso, online shopping (groceries and pharma) has recorded increase, but without showing profits. Heavy industry: oil, gas, aluminium, and fishery are still suffering. Crude oil has recently experienced positivity in production and pricing, but it is still difficult to see how this can relate to the actual supply and demand on a global level.\n\n\nClassic political economical tools are sourcing billions of Euros into infrastructure, aiding the construction business sector.\n\n\nRussia\n\n\nThe Russian developed vaccine EpiVacCorona will be launched for wide-scale vaccination from the second half of March. It was the second vaccine to be registered in Russia.\n\n\nConsumer spending grew by 2.6% in February, which is the highest increase since the pandemic started. According to Sberbank, this is mainly due to a lower perceived risk regarding covid. Retail is doing better in household appliances, computers and electronics, and clothing retail. The entertainment industry is also steadily recovering. Car sales seem to go up as well, with almost 1 % higher sales in February this year compared with February last year.\n\n\nSeveral Russian big corporates made quite a turnaround end of last year as the country defied a second wave. The recovery of the oil price and the removal of many restrictions certainly helped. The CEO of the Russian oil company Rosneft, Igor Sechin, claims that his company was one of few major oil companies in the world that finished 2020 profitable. Russia’s major bank, Sberbank, also saw a similar turnaround from a problematic first half-year to a strong end of 2020 and has continued well first months of 2021. Perhaps the strongest sector was food retail. For instance, X5, a prominent Russian group of several food retail chains, saw its total sales increase by 14% in 2020.\n\n\nUK\n\n\nHardest hit in the last quarter of 2020 were the consumer facing services such as retail trade, food- and beverage-serving activities, and travel and recreation. Latest official data suggest sharp declines in output in these sectors, although not the dramatic collapse they saw during the first wave in April 2020.\n\n\nManufacturing activity has held up, supported by Brexit-related stockpiling in the fourth quarter as companies built up inventories to mitigate the risk of a disruptive, no-deal departure from the European Union. But now that a trade deal has been struck, businesses are likely to run down their stockpiles, dampening first-quarter activity.\n\n\nOverall, we expected the economy to contract in the fourth quarter 2020 and again in the first quarter 2021, leading to a double-dip recession. However, with the corporate sector better prepared to respond to tighter restrictions this time, and government support schemes already in place, these contractions are forecast to be much smaller in scale than the one seen in the second quarter of last year.\n\n\n2020 was a topsy-turvy year for the UK economy. After the deepest economic downturn on record, a strong rebound was cut short by a surge in COVID-19 infections. This year, we expect vaccines and continued policy support to deliver a more sustainable recovery.\n\n\nAMERICAS\n\n\nThe U.S. economy for its part has stayed resilient through the pandemic. Consumer spending has nearly returned to pre-COVID-19 levels, while average personal incomes of U.S. households surpassed pre pandemic levels in September, even after the first round of fiscal support expired.\n\n\nAfter the sharp contraction in the second quarter of last year, the brisk recovery in the third quarter exceeded expectations in some larger economies, like Brazil, Peru, and Argentina. Manufacturing recovered faster than services. Net exports have recovered to pre-crisis levels while consumption and investment are lagging.\n\n\nBrazil\n\n\nIn 2020, due to the adversities brought by Covid-19, the GDP fell 4.1% against 2019, the lowest rate of the timeline series started in 1966 (former estimates indicated a – 9.00%+ rate). In the cumulative yearly rate, GDP, in current values, amounted to US$ 1,443 trillion out of which US$ 1,241 trillion refers to Value Added at basic prices and US$ 193,9 billion to Net Taxes on Products.\n\n\nThere was an increase only in Agriculture of 2.0% and decreases in Industry of -3.5% and Services -4.5%. The GDP totalled US$ 1,443 trillion, in 2020. The Investment Rate in 2020 was 16.4% of GDP vs. 15.4% in 2019, and the Savings Rate was 15% vs. 12.5% in 2019.\n\n\nThe Per Capita GDP reached US$ 6,822 in 2020, down 4.8% in real terms. This was also the lowest rate in the timeline series.\n\n\nIn the foreign front, Export Goods and Services dropped by 1.8%, while Import of Goods and Services fell 10%. A new round of the monthly “Emergency Aid Pay” / “Corona voucher” Program, estimated at around R$ 300,00 (US$ 55.00) per capita, to be paid to a population of 65 million of small informal workers/micro entrepreneurs and unemployed workers will be launched by the government, either in March or April, this year, to be paid for four months.\n\n\nEstimated cost is about US$ 8 billion. Current Unemployment Rate has reached 14.2%.\n\n\nIBGE/” Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics” – Brazilian Government\n\n\nUSA\n\n\nEconomic concerns about the recovery and a possible sell-off in the securities markets are serious concerns for our clients.\n\n\nMarch has been a bit slower than January and February. Pricing pressure is greater than in prior recoveries. The numbers of reported searches are increasing nationally but with many opting for contingency searches only.\n\n\nExecutives are approachable and companies are installing email barriers. Year to date we are well ahead of 2020. We continue to stress business growth and diversity as a reason to visit with us. Technology outages and telephone exchange overload are still real problems.\n\n\nWe hope that you, your family, and work colleagues continue to stay healthy and safe. If you have any questions please feel free to get in touch with us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3635)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

This can be tracked as the pandemic resulted in countrywide and regional lockdowns impacting projects started and then were put on hiatus.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMark Firth, Chairman ,The Taplow Group S.A. remarked\n\n\n“ We entered 2020 with a positive outlook; what transpired became our most challenging year to date for our partners, clients, candidates and their families. Our partner firms weathered the storm and the group grew their revenue streams, which is a testament to our consultants resilience, agility and determination. We welcomed a new partner firm in China into our group to enhance and augment our Executive Search capabilities in this important economic region. The group also enhanced its marketing and social media initiatives, whilst many in our industry ceased or reduced theirs. This resulted in substantial growth in market awareness. However, we saw many countries being severely impacted by multiple county lockdowns occurring during key calendar periods.”\n\n\nAs Mark looked ahead at the 2021 outlook, he said “\nWe foresee executive search services returning to 2019 levels by Q3 2021. Our Human Capital and Interim Executive services are continuing to grow, as businesses continue to react to the evolving situation. We also have strategies in place to grow our organisations presence in the Americas and Asia regions through 2021 and beyond”.\n\n\n\n\nIan Stacy, CFO , The Taplow Group S.A. reflected on the financial results\n\n\n“The results were pleasing when we consider the global market conditions of 2020. Particularly when we consider the devastating pandemic effects in Europe with our partners in Spain, Italy, France, and Germany heavily impacted. The USA performance was a sign of the resilience of this business. India and Africa experienced severe pandemic shock. The APAC region was not as severely impacted and new partners in this region delivered an improving result event when like for like revenue were measured. The Taplow Group continues to offer a business model that delivers outcomes for clients regardless of market conditions.”\n\n\n \n\n\nSangeeta Sabharwal, COO, The Taplow Group S.A. speaking on our partner firm’s performance  \n\n\n\"The positive results, as they have emerged at the end of the year, are a clear sign of the deep level of engagement that our Partner firms enjoy with their clients in each of the markets where The Taplow Group is represented. What has certainly helped, has been the quality of collaboration and uniformity of processes amongst the Partners in the different regions of the world. The fact that The Taplow Group is being chosen as the preferred global supplier for global corporations, has also provided the group with the much-needed impetus, in an otherwise incredibly challenging year“. \nSangeeta summed up 2020 thoughts\n,” a combination of expansion of our network in APAC & Europe at one level and the consolidation of operational processes and policies, has together worked to minimize the impact of the pandemic and deliver positive results.”\n\n\n\n\nThe Taplow Group S.A.\n\r\nEstablished in 2002, the group has 21 partner firms, located across 6 continents in 18 countries. Our partner firms offer Executive Search, Human Capital, Board Advisory and Executive Interim services across multiple industry sectors.\n\n\n\n\nContact\n : Karina Kratholm, VP Administration: \nClick Here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3831)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

If we hear the word \"diversity,\" we think of race and maybe history. For instance, when it comes to the diversity of gender, race, and culture are crucial factors. Yet, the word \"diversity\" in itself is a lot broader. Diversity cuts through all facets of our lives and plays an important role, as important as helping us survive.\n\n\n\r\nDiversity in the workplace is all about building an inclusive atmosphere, embracing the variations of each person, encouraging all workers to reach their full potential, which, as a result, enables the company to achieve its fullest potential. If you respect each individual's differences, you encourage each individual to add their specific insights, which can have an incredibly positive effect on jobs, other workers, morale, success and customer service. Workplace diversity is not only a trend for integration; it is something that most businesses are striving to do.\n\n\n\r\nThere is a beauty richness that can arise when an organisation agrees that it needs internal diversity when it comes to meeting potential partners that are diverse. Those members like to connect with someone like them, so African-Americans need to interact with African-Americans. We think there's a risk that people will get pigeonholes. \nBoard\n diversity matters, so it is not enough to concentrate on only one aspect of diversity. Research has shown that social diversity (e.g. gender, race/ethnicity and age diversity) and technical diversity are also critical for increasing the diversity of views reflected on the board.\n\n\n\r\nMany boards often widen the spectrum of professional experiences considered for board member posts, helping them to recruit more socially diverse directors who, as one interviewee referred to it, offer \"diversity of opinion.\" As one of the long-standing directors of the \n Taplow Group\n put it: \"The challenge is how boards are shaped and how positions are filled. That may be an inherent bias. It's laziness sometimes. 'Oh, we've got an opening, who do we know?' They have expressed that many times the board members just met people like them.\n\n\n\n\nIdeate together\n\r\nWhen \n recruiting\n is done from diverse backgrounds, nationalities, and cultures, you add a new set of experiences to the table. This will contribute to advantages such as improved problem solving and increased efficiency. Something similar to a scavenger hunt: Achieving more success by sending everyone to the squad in the same direction? Or are you trying to collect information more efficiently by getting a strategically divided squad?\n\n\n\r\nSome recruiting managers may feel overwhelming about the prospect of getting new perspectives into the business. People may be scared of possible humiliation or the inclusion of controversial views. But analysis should set your mind at rest, revealing that several teams see a 60% growth in decision-making abilities.\n\n\n\n\nInnovation \n\r\nDiversity in the workplace contributes to creativity. When you think about something, it's crucial to have a connection. If you have a homogenous group of individuals, it is possible that anything – from their cognitive habits to personal experiences to problem-solving skills – will also be identical. And the sameness would not contribute to imaginative ideas. On the other hand, a heterogeneous community of workers will add new insights that can lead to breakthroughs in philosophy.\n\n\n\r\nIt's the same explanation why businesses travel off-site for crucial planning sessions or why a shift of tempo will help you fix the issue you've been stuck with for days. New conditions and environments are considered to give rise to fresh ideas.\n\n\n\n\nUnity\n\r\nDiversity and inclusion go hand in hand. If you create a work atmosphere where workers see a picture of a range of races, experiences, and ways of thought, they are more likely to be relaxed on their own. This translates to a healthier, more active population.\n\n\n\r\nOn the other hand, research has shown that a large, homogeneous society can stifle natural cognitive diversity due to the pressure to conform. If workers don't feel like they should be themselves at work, they are more likely to risk failure and not do their best work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (4871)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Taplow partners across the globe have combined to give you local and regional insights on business situation coupled with pandemic updates.\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings:\n\n\nCompanies \n\r\nGlobal output and demand are likely to rebound strongly in 2021, driven by the rollout of vaccines and continued fiscal and monetary policy support. Inflation should creep up only moderately in 2021. We are seeing growth in countries who have emerged from lockdowns with pent up consumer confidence returning quickly.\n\n\n\n\nExecutives \n\r\nOrganizational adaptability may sound counterintuitive to goal setting, but one big lesson from Covid-19 is that we need more adaptable organizations and executives that are structured and have holistic views of their businesses and markets.\n\n\n\n\nEmployees \n\r\nMany countries have in place furlough or policies in place to keep people in their employment. Most of these initiatives will end in Q2 2021 and unemployment will rise before falling back in Q4 2021.\n\n\n\n\nAFRICA:\n\r\nThe number of confirmed COVID-19 cases on the African continent reached 3,729,019 as of Saturday, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) said. According to the continental disease control and prevention agency's Africa COVID-19 dashboard, the death toll related to the pandemic stood at 97,832 as of Saturday afternoon.\n\r\nA total of 3,271,170 people infected with COVID-19 have recovered across the continent so far, the agency disclosed.\n\n\n\r\nThe Southern Africa region is the most COVID-19 affected area in Africa in terms of the number of confirmed positive cases, followed by the Northern Africa region, according to the Africa CDC.\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa \n\r\nSA is likely to see economic growth of 2.9% y/y in 2021 as it rebounds from the -7.3% y/y collapse of last year. This muted recovery has been accompanied by an unsustainable expansion in Government borrowings and a widening fiscal deficit.\n\n\n\r\nPlanned Government borrowings for 2021/22 sit at R4.6 trillion (86% of GDP), and are forecast to reach R5.5 trillion by 2023/24 (93% of GDP) and 95% of GDP by 2025/26. As these ratios deteriorate and SA sinks deeper into a debt trap, lower credit ratings are all but guaranteed.\n\n\n\n\nASIA:\n\r\nDigital platforms and other technology-based tools are providing new growth opportunities for businesses of all sizes and across all industries in Asia and the Pacific—a trend which could contribute significantly to the region’s sustainable recovery from the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, according to a new report by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\n\n\n\r\n“Countries in Asia and the Pacific have leveraged rapid technological progress and digitalization to recover and reconnect to the global economy during the pandemic. Technology is helping to forge new global linkages, which offer enormous economic opportunities, but also present new risks and challenges,” said ADB Chief Economist Yasuyuki Sawada. “It is imperative to implement policies and regulations that manage the disruptions and maximize the gains from the burgeoning digital economy, and to lock in these gains through enhanced regional cooperation.”\n\n\n\n\nAustralia \n\r\nRight around the country, businesses are re-opening, confidence is growing, and people are getting back to work. Australia’s business, social and economic comeback is happening and quite real.\n\n\n\r\nThere is consumer confidence, and this is translating into retail expenditure. We are in the company reporting season and the results are encouraging.\n\n\n\r\nThe Australian Federal Treasurer reported “The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is forecasting the economy of Spain to contract by 11 per cent; the UK by 10 per cent; Italy and France by 9 per cent; Canada, Germany and Japan by more than 5 per cent and the United States by 3.4 per cent. It is in stark contrast to Australia at less than 3 per cent. “\n\n\n\r\nConsumer confidence rose and is now up in 16 of the last 20 weeks. Business confidence increased across all industries and is strongest in retail. Nearly 80,000 motor vehicles were sold in January, up more than 10 per cent over the year. New housing approvals increased for the sixth consecutive month, up more than 20 per cent over the year. There is a fall in the unemployment rate to 6.6 per cent, and ninety per cent of the 1.3 million Australians who lost their jobs or saw their working hours reduced to zero are now back at work. The strength of the labour market has exceeded even the most optimistic forecasts of Treasury and the Reserve Bank of Australia.\n\n\n\r\nInternational returns to Australia are causing some isolated cluster COVID19 circumstances. However the Commonwealth Government and the State Governments are responding quickly and proactively to these circumstances. Cases have been as a consequence of returned international travellers not community transmission. Immunisation begins in February and is expected to have the population covered by September.\n\n\n\n\nIndia\n\n\nOverview of Indian Economy\n\r\nIndia's economy is projected to grow at 7.3 per cent in 2021, even as it is estimated to contract by 9.6 per cent in 2020 as lockdowns and other efforts to control the Covid-19 pandemic slashed domestic consumption, the UN has said.\n\n\n\r\nAgriculture remained the silver lining and outperformed all the sectors during the pandemic. Consumer-facing services, manufacturing, and construction were hit hardest, but have started recovering.\n\n\n\r\nThe Indian start-up ecosystem, which defied odds during a pandemic-hit year to create record 12 unicorns, has the potential to be the engine of growth in the medium to long run, according to the Economic Survey 2020-21. Currently, India is home to 38 unicorns — start-ups with a valuation of over $1 billion — as per the Nasscom Tech Start-up Report 2021.\n\n\n\n\nGovernment Initiatives\n\r\nThe Government of India announced US$36 billion stimulus package to generate job opportunities and provide liquidity support to various sectors such as tourism, aviation, construction, and housing.\n\n\n\r\nIndia's cabinet approved the production-linked incentives (PLI) scheme to provide US$27 billion over five years to create jobs and boost production in the country.\n\n\n\r\nThe Government of India, under its Make in India initiative, is trying to boost the contribution made by the manufacturing sector with an aim to take it to 25% of the GDP from the current 17%.\n\n\n\r\nTo facilitate the growth of start-up’s, the Indian Government had announced the 'Start-up India, Stand-up India' initiative. As of 23 December 2020, the Indian Government has recognised a total of 41,061 start-ups and 4.7 lakh jobs have been reported by more than 39,000 start-ups.\n\n\n\n\nSector Wise Investment\n\r\nRoads & Highways Infrastructure: Infrastructure sector received an allocation of US$16.20 billion.\n\n\n\r\nLife Sciences & Health Care: Health and well-being topped the priority list in the recently concluded Budget. The total allocation to the health care sector is US$30.70 Billion, a 137 percent increase over the past year.\n\n\n\r\nPorts, Shipping & Waterways: US$274.29 million to be offered in PPP-mode in FY21-22 for operation of major ports.\n\n\n\r\nPower Sector: A comprehensive National Hydrogen Energy Mission 2021-22 to be launched in 2021-22.\n\n\n\r\nAutomotive Sector Reforms: The announcement of voluntary vehicle scrapping policy to reduce vehicular pollution and oil import bill is a welcome move and should boost demand in the industry.\n\n\n\n\nIndia - Road ahead\n\r\nIndia is expected to attract foreign direct investments (FDI) of US$120-160 billion per year by 2025, according to CII and EY report. Over the past 10 years, the country witnessed a 6.8% rise in GDP with FDI increasing to GDP at 1.8%.\n\n\n\n\nSingapore\n\r\nSingapore’s economy shrank a record 5.8 per cent in a pandemic-hit 2020 according to preliminary data released last month although most industries saw some improvement in the fourth quarter of last year as COVID-19 restrictions were eased. Recovery in 2021 will depend on how its vaccination drive progresses as well as the rate of similar initiatives in other countries particularly the United States and Europe.\n\n\n\r\nSingapore announced its 2030 Green Plan to strengthen Singapore’s economic, climate and resource resilience, improve the living environment of Singaporeans, and bring new business and job opportunities. They are entitled: \"Green Economy\", \"City in Nature\", \"Sustainable Living\", \"Energy Reset\" and \"Resilient Future\".\n\n\n\r\nSingapore will aim to become a sustainable tourism destination, a leading centre for green finance and services to facilitate Asia’s transition to a low-carbon and sustainable future, as well as a leading regional centre for developing new sustainability solutions.\n\n\n\r\nIt is designed as a “whole-of-nation movement” to advance Singapore's agenda on sustainable development over the next 10 years.\n\n\n\r\nDaily COVID-19 cases in the community have been kept to single digits with majority of the cases coming from overseas this past two months.\n\n\n\r\nThis Chinese New Year, the Government has announced new measures to curb transmission. Per day, household can host at most eight visitors and visitors can only visit two households.\n\n\n\n\nNew Zealand\n\r\nThe latest New Zealand Institute of Economic Research Quarterly Survey of Business Opinion shows a further improvement in business confidence in the final quarter of 2020, as businesses held onto the recovery in sales seen in September.\n\n\n\r\nA net 16 percent of businesses expect a deterioration in general economic conditions over the coming months, on a seasonally adjusted basis – lower than the 38 percent in the previous quarter, and well below the 68 percent of businesses feeling pessimistic in March 2020. When it comes to firms’ own trading activity, a net 1 percent reported reduced demand on a seasonally adjusted basis. This measure suggests a rebound in annual GDP growth to around 2 percent at the end of 2020 from the lockdown lows in mid-2020.\n\r\nStrong construction demand boosts sentiment in the building sector The building sector remains the most optimistic of the sectors surveyed, as strong construction demand supports a lift in confidence. With the pipeline of residential, non-residential and Government construction work increasing, building sector firms are hiring to keep up with demand. The rebound in construction activity is driving capacity utilisation in the sector to record highs.\n\n\n\r\nAlthough sentiment in the other sectors has improved, businesses are generally still cautious about general economic conditions ahead. Demand has improved in most of the other sectors, but firms are still finding it difficult to pass on rising costs by raising prices. This is weighing on firm profitability.\n\r\nFirms looking to hire and invest Despite weak profitability, increased certainty about the outlook is encouraging businesses to hire and invest. A net 15 percent of firms are planning to increase headcount in the next quarter, while a net 10 percent of firms are looking to invest in plant and machinery. These results indicate a recovery in employment and business investment over 2021.\n\n\n \n\n\nAs employment demand improves, labour shortages are becoming more acute. This is particularly the case for skilled labour, with a net 43 percent reporting difficulty in finding skilled labour – close to levels seen in early 2020. Capacity utilisation rises to record highs The strong rebound in construction demand has underpinned a surge in capacity pressures in the building sector, with capacity utilisation rising to record highs. This increase in capacity pressures should support a lift in wider inflation pressures later in 2021.\n\n\n\n\nEUROPE:\n\r\nThe region is in the midst of a Covid second wave; many countries are experiencing some form of lockdown and restriction of movement. Whilst vaccines are being dispatched, start up production issues have led to lower than anticipated numbers being delivered. The EU is seeking alternate supplies from India/ Russia or China to bolster numbers of vaccinees available.\n\n\n\n\nFrance\n\r\nThe Governor of the Banque de France, François Villeroy de Galhau, confirmed the forecast of 5% growth in France in 2021, established by the institution in December. This is a \"robust and rather cautious forecast, while of course recalling the strong health uncertainty\", added the governor of the Banque de France. \"Thus, after its strongest recession since 1945 last year (-8.3%), the French economy in 2021 would record its strongest growth since 1973 and the oil shock,\" the official said.\n\n\n\r\n\"In the autumn, the French economy resisted better than expected, with a loss of activity limited to -7% in November and -5% in December, five times less than during the first containment,\" he added. The fourth quarter of 2020, marked throughout France by a six-week period of confinement followed by a curfew (from mid-December), could not escape a fall in GDP. But the fall was limited to -1.3%. This second containment caused much less damage than the first: in November, activity was 11% below normal (i.e. in the fourth quarter of 2019, just before the pandemic), when it had fallen by 30% in April .\n\n\n\r\n\"Compared to the euro zone (-6.8% in 2020, +4% in 2021), we have plunged more sharply, due to the confinement of spring, but we would rebound better, I add that unemployment should rise less than we feared, given the best employment figures at the end of 2020,\" he said.\n\n\n\r\nEvoking the beginning of 2021, François Villeroy de Galhau noted that \"faced with a severe shock, the French economy is resisting rather well overall, with a loss of activity of -5% in January compared to the pre-Covid period, and expected again around -5% in February\". \"This resilience is both a good surprise for the end of 2020, and reinsurance for 2021\", judges François Villeroy de Galhau.\n\n\n\n\nGermany\n\r\nIn Germany, the actual lockdown will end in different steps starting in March with school openings and barber shop openings agreed upon, others especially in retail sectors is still to be defined - for some ones it is too early because they fear an additional pandemic wave - for others it is not fast enough. Retail - with exception food and essential - and gastronomy - with a few take a way or delivery options - and hospitality etc. are closed, cultural entities as well.\n\n\n\r\nMost executives continue to work from home. Manufacturing Industry sectors and chemistry and pharmacy production is still performing but facing some restraints due to some border closings due to virus hot spots in other countries. In financial services most assets driven business is performing, others are under cost cutting pressure, there are declines expected to come later this year or next year because of a lot of value adjustments that shall be needed. Professional services sectors are diverging.\n\n\n\r\nDigitalization in all sectors is accelerating and threat for more environment and Government components in business is still increasing. Government money spent in packages to avoid collapse of firms and unemployment is tremendous, many are unsure how long this could be affordable.\n\n\n\r\nGenerally, there had been some enthusiasm about the announced vaccine availabilities in end of 2020. That changed a bit, many persons are complaining now about many things.\n\n\n\r\nThis is a federal election year: Due to unification engagement in the EU the vaccination is slow but should be accelerating as the federal elections are in September. The general feeling of a majority is down or decreasing, but when lockdown is eased, spring arrives and temperatures outside increase and vaccination is advancing, that will improve - expected around Easter.\n\n\n\n\nRussia\n\r\nOfficial statistics say that Russia has by now vaccinated around 2.2 million people (1.5% of the population), some already received both parts of the vaccination. The number of coronavirus infections is declining daily. Many regions, in particular Moscow, lifted a variety of restrictions and restaurants, bars and nightclubs are allowed to open again, if obeying to the hygiene measures.\n\n\n\r\nAfter a high efficiency mentioned about the Russian vaccine Sputnik V in the Lancet, Russia hopes for an export success. The vaccine is already approved in 27 countries. In Europe Montenegro has approved the vaccine and Hungary already started to use it. Russia has approved that Sputnik V can be produced in Serbia and there are discussion with other countries. The application to register the Russian vaccine in the EU was recently approved. Russia has two more vaccines in the making. One of them is supposed to go into mass production shortly.\n\n\n\r\nThe Russian Minister of Economic Development estimates a 3.9% growth in investment for 2021. The unemployment rate is decreasing according to official statistics. It now stands at 5.9% compared to 6.6% in 2020. President Vladimir Putin is confident that Russia will reach the pre-crisis rate of 4.7% this year. In total, the Russian Economy shrunk by 3.1% in 2020, which is less severe than estimated.\n\n\n\n\nUK\n\r\nThe UK economy shrank by a record 9.9% last year as coronavirus restrictions hit output, official figures show.\n\n\n\r\nThe contraction in 2020 \"was more than twice as much as the previous largest annual fall on record\", the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. However, the economy looks set to avoid a double-dip recession after growth picked up at the end of the year.\n\n\n\r\nIn December, the economy grew by 1.2%, after shrinking by 2.3% in November, as some restrictions eased. Hospitality, car sales and hairdressers recovered some lost ground, the ONS said. The growth meant that in the October-to-December quarter the economy expanded by 1%. As a result, the UK is expected to avoid what could have been its first double-dip recession since the 1970s.\n\n\n\r\nThe prospect of vaccines reaching all vulnerable groups by April could herald a gradual easing of social restrictions with a return to normal by the autumn in our main scenario. This could see GDP grow by 4.2% in 2021. While the UK managed to secure a deal with the EU, avoiding significant disruptions to trade, the realities of the new trading relationship will dampen economic growth for a while.\n\n\n\r\nUncertainty about progress in combating the pandemic could see growth oscillate between 5.6% in our upside scenario and 2.2% in our downside scenario in 2021.Government intervention, and in particular its Job Retention Scheme should help keep unemployment relatively low considering the size of the negative shock experienced by the economy. Unemployment could peak at 6.3% this summer and average 6% this year.\n\n\n\r\nThe expiry of the VAT cut to hospitality businesses should see inflation rise in April, although we expect the headline inflation rate will remain below the Bank of England’s 2% target over the next two years.\n\n\n\n\nAMERICAS:\n\r\nThe Latin America and the Caribbean region will experience a contraction of -7.7% in 2020 but will have a positive growth rate of 3.7% in 2021, mainly due to a statistical rebound that will nonetheless be insufficient for recovering the economic activity levels seen prior to the coronavirus pandemic (in 2019), ECLAC indicated today in a new report.\n\n\n\n\nBrazil\n\r\nDespite new infections and fatalities remaining high, the economy has started to recover across a wide range of sectors. GDP growth is expected to be 2.6% in 2021 and 2.2% in 2022, but activity will still fall short of pre-pandemic levels by late 2022. Inflation will remain below target and high liquidity provision, including through record-low interest rates, will support investment. Fiscal vulnerabilities have been exacerbated by the necessary policy response and public debt has risen. A failure to continue structural reform progress could hold back investment and future growth.\n\n\n\r\nThe strong fiscal and monetary policy response managed to prevent a sharper economic contraction. A temporary emergency benefit has supported over 67 million low-income households, cushioning the impact on household incomes and poverty. As the recovery will take time and some jobs may not return, well-targeted improvements in social protection would be warranted. Reallocating some current expenditures and raising spending efficiency would allow such improvements to be financed, while simultaneously resuming the fiscal adjustment underway before the pandemic. Structural reforms will enhance domestic and external competition and improve the investment climate that could raise productivity, while better professional training would allow more people to seize new economic opportunities.\n\n\n\n\nCanada\n\r\nCanada’s 2021 economic outlook is similar to that of other developed countries. After the largest economic contraction since 1945 (a dip we estimate at 5.5% of GDP), the economy should grow sufficiently to largely offset the losses of 2020.\n\n\n\r\nStrong consumption and a rebound in exports will give the Canadian economy a boost. Bringing forward government investment projects should also provide a tailwind to Canadian economic growth. Conversely, the postponement of business investments and a slowdown in the housing market will limit the extent of the recovery.\n\n\n\r\nOntario, which had the strictest health restrictions in 2020, could experience the country’s strongest economic growth in 2021. New investment in the automotive manufacturing sector is expected to give an additional boost to the province’s manufacturing sector. A resurgence in immigration should also revitalize the economy, particularly in the Greater Toronto Area. Growth of 4.5% is expected in Ontario.\n\n\n\n\nUSA\n\r\nIn the first 100 days of the Biden administration, the policy agenda will focus on a fiscal stimulus package, steps to combat the pandemic as well as immigration reform, but no tax hikes.\n\n\n\r\nIn addition, expect the new president to reaffirm the trans-Atlantic partnership, reduce trade tensions, and pursue improved relations with Canada and Mexico. US tariffs on China will not suddenly reverse, but the rhetoric is expected to be less heated.\n\n\n\r\nAccording to the most recent forecast released at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Dec. 16, 2020, U.S. GDP growth is expected to contract by 2.4% in 2020. It is estimated to then rebound up to a 4.2% growth rate in 2021, and slow to 3.2% in 2022, and 2.4% in 2023.\n\n\n\r\nWe hope that you, your family, and work colleagues continue to stay healthy and safe.

You can have your finances, CAPEX, and infrastructure, but if you select the wrong professionals to lead your organization, then that could be the biggest downfall. Every organization must select the right professionals to steer them on the perfect path in this dynamic business landscape. \n Industrial professional recruitment\n is easier said than done. It is a daunting task to find the right talent, with matching technical competencies and cultural traits to align with your organization’s culture and vision. \nHow to design the best \n IT services executive search\n strategy? If you want an answer then follow the next section to find out how you can emerge as a winner in your professional search endeavors.\nClear and Compelling Job Description\nThe job description is the first touchpoint between your organization and the potential candidates. You need to ensure that you prepare the job description in such a way that it attracts people. There should be complete details about the role, responsibilities, the skills that you are looking for, and also how life would look when someone would join your organization. At the same time, ensure that you update the vacancies as and when they get filled.\n \nMake it a Collaborative Venture\nThe candidates recruited via \nndustrial professional recruitment services\n work with your associates in different teams.  Many-a-times, you might select the best candidate with exceptional skills and experience, but what if that candidate turns out to be a poor team-player. Hence, you must include fellow team members in the selection process. Involve the team in the second or third round where they can understand the dynamics of the person and decide who would groove perfectly into the team and organization at large.\nCultural Fit is a must\nYou might get many suitable candidates with the necessary skill set or maybe even beyond that. But that should not be the be-all and end-all criteria for selection. Cultural fit and organization alignment is a very important aspect of \n industrial professional recruitment\n strategies. This where your team members would also help you find the most suitable candidate. During interviews, you need to find out the nature of the person, the work ethics the person carries, conflict management abilities, people skills, and alignment with your vision. Try to gauge the personality of a candidate as much as possible during the interview rounds.\nGo for Professional Services\nAll these seem to be overwhelming for you, isn’t it? You can always reduce your load and take help from the IT services executive search professionals. They know the market, the kind of talent pool present, and match candidates who would align with your organization perfectly. These professionals would always keep you in the loop throughout the recruitment process. \nChoose the \n best industrial professional recruitment services\n and hire the right talent that would help your organization grow and thrive perfectly.

The responsibilities of an executive search consultant ranges from preparing the job profile, headhunting the best candidates to scheduling interviews, selecting the best, and preparing for a smooth onboarding process. Clearly, the role of \n executive recruitment consultants\n is not an easy one and hence there are certain skills and traits that every \n executive search consultant\n must possess.\nThough it is recommended that one has a bachelor’s degree in Human Resource, yet there are plenty of executive consultants who have completed their graduation in business, marketing, language, banking, or any other field for that matter.\nBut there are certain attributes or traits that are non-negotiable. If you have these qualities, then you are all set to become a successful \n executive search consultant.\nExcellent Communication Skills\nTo be successful at executive search management consulting, you need to be an excellent communicator. You must possess the ability to adjust your communication style depending on the situation and person. You need to be good at both direct face-to-face and indirect (calls and emails) communication. An executive search consultant is a liaison between the candidates and the organization. Communication skills also include good listening skills. It would help you to understand the feedback and apply it for a successful search.\nProfound Industry Knowledge\nExperts at executive search services are known for their deep industry knowledge. Most of them are experienced in some industry or the other. They know the latest market trends, the demands in the market, the skill set needed by an individual to succeed in these scenarios, and thus will find the right person to fill the executive position. You must nurture your knowledge and keep adding to it all the time.\nGood Networking Skills\nOne of the unique advantages that an executive search consultant carries is his/her wide network of connections. Friends, colleagues, or even family members can become a potential candidate. You need to grow your network and increase the quality of your network. Make sure you connect with your contacts regularly, keep yourself and them updated, and thus build a network of trust. Remember, it is often said that your net worth is your network.\nFocused and Detail-Oriented\nThe difference between regular recruiters and executive recruitment consultants is that executive consultants are always detail-oriented and focused on their work. You need to find the key information, background details, experiences, and the alignment of the candidate. Every single detail in executive search is important. There is no room for any mistakes.\nMulti-Tasking Abilities\nIf you are not good at multi-tasking or working under pressure, then this is not your field. Preparing job descriptions, shortlisting resumes, conducting interviews, and onboarding candidates involve a lot of multi-tasking. At times you must fill vacancies in less than a week. Hence, strong time-management skills and a composed mind become imperative for executive search consultants.\nThe primary thing that you need is a passion for this profession. Then you will automatically develop these skills, and these will keep improving with experience. Work smart, love your work, have faith in yourself, and taste success all the way along.\nAt \n The Taplow Group\n we help you source the best-fit for your organization’s leadership through our executive search consultants.

    "content": "The Taplow Group – EMEA Region 2021 Business Outlook\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nTuesday, December 22, 2020\n/\nCategories: \nNews\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we head towards the end of a tumultuous year and look towards 2021, Taplow partners across the globe have combined to give local and regional insights on the business outlook for the New Year.\nEMEA Region\nAfrica\nThe region will rebound in 2021, however growth will vary across countries. While South Africa is expected to experience a weak recovery, overall growth in Eastern and Southern Africa region is expected to average 2.7%. While Nigeria’s economic recovery will be weak, the Western and Central Africa region is expected to experience an average growth of 1.4%. Many countries have seized the opportunity within the crisis to move faster on necessary reforms and investments that will be crucial for long-term development. However, concerns of a second wave are fuelling further uncertainty.\nIn South Africa, there are various estimates of the economic fallout for 2020, ranging from real GDP growth of –7.8% (National Treasury), and –8.2% (South African Reserve Bank) to –11.5% (OECD).\nGiven the magnitude of the expected contraction in an already-weak economy, the need for concerted action to transition onto a path of economic recovery has become even more urgent. Policy tools, such as the emergency fiscal stimulus and an easier monetary policy stance, are likely to only cushion some of the worst impacts.\nThe outlook for African banks in 2021 is stable as operating conditions and activity recover gradually, translating to slightly higher business volumes and a rebuilding of lost revenues, but a return to pre-pandemic performance levels is unlikely for at least another two years. Fitch forecasts a moderate economic recovery across the region (4% for 2021 vs -3% for 2020). The high uncertainty around the global economy continues to weigh on African economies. Market volatility is unlikely to ease. Currencies will remain weak against the US dollar. Asset-quality deterioration will be more pronounced in 2021 given the severity of the shock and protracted recovery of key industries (especially commodities and export-oriented sectors), rising unemployment and the likely increase in corporate defaults, exacerbated by the unwinding of debt relief and other support measures.\nAfrica’s annual investment in infrastructure has doubled to around $80 billion a year since the beginning of this century. There is also an important opportunity to grow manufacturing exports and make Africa the world’s next great manufacturing centre as industries shift away from China to lower-cost regions.\nSub-Saharan Africa saw the world’s fastest rate of new broadband connections between 2008 and 2015, and mobile data traffic across Africa is expected to increase sevenfold between 2017 and 2022. Africa has more than 120 million active mobile money accounts, over 50 percent of the global total; this has leapfrogged many people over traditional banking products.\nDenmark\nThe expansionary fiscal policy as well as taking active measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 have helped Denmark relatively well through the crisis in 2020 compared to other countries. Research shows that the Danish GDP is falling less than expected in the latest report in August. The reason behind this is an economic recovery in the third quarter as well as active stimulus measures.\nHowever, Denmark is currently going through a new wave of infection and is now in the most critical and uncertain situation since March, which may change the outcome of this research. The Financial Statement forecasts that the Danish economy is expected to grow by 2.8 percent in 2021 and 3.1 percent in 2022 after a lessening of 3.8 percent this year. The decline in Danish economy 2020 will thus be smaller than previously expected. However, it must be emphasized that these forecasts have been made before the current spread of COVID-19 and therefore there is still a high uncertainty in the upcoming economic situation.\nThe Danish Minister of Finance, Morten Bødskov states: The report shows that the Danish economy has far fared well through the corona crisis compared to many other countries. With the figures we have now, our active fiscal policy will cover 55,000 Danish jobs next year. At the same time, however, it is important to that that we are currently in the most critical and uncertain situation since March with a new wave of infection, which must be expected to have a negative effect on the economy. Therefore, the government’s priority remains to get Denmark and the Danish economy through the crisis as safely as possible. The fiscal policy measures that have contributed to strengthening the economy in 2020 include both economic aid packages and stimulus measures.\nOverall, the government’s economic policy is estimated to hold up to 55,000 jobs in 2021, and 45,000 jobs in 2022. The Danish economy is still fundamentally healthy, and the economic measures are helping to prevent the crisis from becoming even deeper and this even more expensive. Even though we will have a deficit in 2020, it will not the greater than the profit it was the year before. Denmark’s economy will remain robust”.\nReference: Danish Ministry of Finance\nFrance\nAfter a steep drop in activity in the second quarter, during the first lockdown, then a very marked rebound from June to September, the French economy is undergoing another negative shock at the end of the year linked to the resurgence of the epidemic and to the health measures put in place. This second lockdown, which was eased at the end of November with the reopening of non-essential shops, is having a significant impact, but one that is much less severe than in the spring. GDP is thus projected to decline by around 9% over the full year 2020.\nAccording to the Banque de France, at the start of 2021, economic activity should be penalised by continuing constraints on household consumption as the health measures are expected to be lifted gradually.\nThe Banque de France baseline scenario assumes that the epidemic will not end immediately and that vaccines will only be fully rolled out towards the end of 2021. Under these conditions, activity is only projected to return to its 2019 level in mid-2022, and the recovery will be spread over 2021 and 2022 with GDP growth of around 5% in both of those years. In 2023, growth is projected to remain slightly above 2%, which is still a high rate, albeit less unusual.\nThanks to the cushioning provided by public finances, household purchasing power should be preserved in average terms in 2020 and 2021, despite the recession. Business investment should rebound sharply in 2021 after plunging by 10% in 2020.\nAlthough the short-time work schemes have helped to limit the deterioration in the labour market in the short run, a delayed downturn is expected to take hold in the coming quarters, pushing the unemployment rate to a peak of close to 11% in the first half of 2021. It should then fall back towards 9% by the end of 2022.\nFinland\nGDP growth in Finland is estimated to be around 3% in 2021 in comparison to 4,3% drop in 2020. The recovery will be gradual and slow.\nFinland still remains one of less infected countries in Europe throughout the Pandemic in 2020. Restrictions and following them are key success factors, as well as natural social distance in a country of few people.\nPolitical situation is also rather stable and no major elections taking place in 2021. The left-wing government has been in place for 2 years now. Traditionally strong manufacturing and machinery industry has taken a hit due to pandemic together with travel and tourism of course.\nFinland seems to finally finalize the huge social and health service renewal, which has been in process for last 6 years. This changes and opens the market more towards private health care service providers. We have an aging population and the need for services will grow. Finland will have too many people retiring in near future to maintain sustainable income and have decided to make changes towards having people staying in work for a longer time.\nGermany\nIn Q3 in Germany the GDP procurement index and other business benchmarks were slightly better than expected as many business sectors were operating again after the 1st lockdown; GDP +8,2% Q3 compared to Q2 of 2020 and more than1 per cent better than expected, equivalent -4,2% down to Q3 of 2019, Q4 will be down again, since 2nd of November a lockdown light is in place. Restaurants are closed, gyms are closed, hotels are closed for all private stays. However, shops and schools remain open. This will remain with a few adjustments at least until end of 2020.\nBenchmarks reflecting the pandemic situation are still better than in the neighbour countries, including the business benchmarks. The international dependency of Germany is larger than in most other countries therefore trade impacts will hurt more in the next months. The vaccine news had already started some positive impacts but still companies in many segments are not investing and waiting or performing intensive cost cutting to improve resilience. Common view is: In 2021 there will be growth, but there are scenarios indicating that the GDP of 2019 will be reached again only in 2023. Tremendous government support packages - slightly larger ones than in neighbour countries - are welcomed but strongly questioned on how that could be paid back once, same applies to EU recovery packages as well. - All specific numbers and statistics are available for public on EU webpages.\nRates of employments look still good due to short-work programs and many firms are waiting because if they need qualified employees again in the future they may face difficulties to get them, therefore they try other cost saving measures instead of making people redundant. Larger firms try to promote internally or to fill leadership roles in standby and some roles requiring more experience are left unfilled longer, young talents and entry-levels are hired.\nThere are sectors that are performing as usual, some are showing improvement, many have declines or nearly zero business. Some sector examples: Automotive and Manufacturing see declines; Constructions see growth; Banking, Private Equity and Real Estate - as usual but with different threats and see problems arising; Insurance - face cost problems evolving, Pharmacy - many perform very good with exceptions; Healthcare - heterogeneous, mostly declining if not in the pandemic recovering chain; Chemistry - some declines; Food Retail - strong increase; Online Retail - strong increase; Other Retail - decline; all Hospitality - strong decline; Culture - strong decline; Professional Services - some - especially governance and IT related ones - look good but many decline, if tasks could be postponed most customers are trying that.\nItaly\nThe economy is set to rebound and recover most of this year’s losses in 2021. Investment activity should be supported by increased EU funding and an accommodative fiscal policy stance, while the reopening of the global economy should fuel foreign demand. However, waves of Covid-19 infections and a high public debt cloud the outlook. Focus Economics panellists project activity to expand 5.7% in 2021, which is down 0.1 percentage points from last month’s forecast, and 2.7% in 2022.\nItaly is set to receive as much as 209 billion euros ($246 billion) in grants and loans under the European Union’s recovery fund. Finance Minister Roberto Gualtieri has pledged to disclose a “significant” long-term target for reducing the country’s crippling debt, which stood at 134.7% at the end of 2019.\nNorway\nAnticipated growth in GDP for Norway in 2021 is between 3,5 and 5,8 %. This will bring Norway back to approximately 2018 level. National Interest rate is still 0,25% but expected to rise slowly from Q3 or Q4 In 2021.\nUnemployment rate is still low, 5.5%, but this is relatively high in Norwegian standards. Expected to be between 3.6% and 4% at the end of 2021\nTravel and tourism are the sectors, which obviously are badly hurt. Also, sports, theatres and other cultural players are struggling; but this has little influence on the Norwegian economy. Business-life in general is going reasonably well. More on-line shopping, but this too has relatively little impact on the economy.\nThere will be a national election for new Government in September. After 8 years with a conservative Government polls suggest this will change. This will probably lead to more taxation, and perhaps a setback for a part of our industry.\nRussia\nThe Russian state is continuing to support businesses with various measures but must deal with serious challenges. RUB dropped by about 30% in the last 11 months compared with EUR, and there is no clear view on whether it will stabilize. The low demand in Russia's crucial sector of oil and gas puts continuous pressure on the economy.\nConsumption and purchasing power has been down this year but an increase early next year is likely. Social benefits which will be increased in 2021 and as Russians could not spend so much in 2020 the savings from this year might lead to higher consumption during 2021. Russian exports of 2020 are estimated to decline by up to 21% compared to last years. Imports are growing and will continue to grow; the Russian Central Bank estimates an import growth of 3.9-5.9 % for 2021. The foreign direct investments decreased by 80% to EUR 4.2 billion, out of which Germany stood for 1.3 billion.\nWorld Bank states that social policies put in place by Russian Government earlier this year including increase in the maximum level of unemployment benefits and a series of family allowances are compensating the severe impact of the crisis on employment and disposable incomes. However, the crisis has increased unemployment in all regions but with most job losses concentrated in manufacturing, construction, and retail / hospitality services. In September, the unemployment was at 6.35% according to CEIC.\nIn the World Bank's annual report on the Russian economy, it is said that stimulative fiscal and monetary policies, a high share of the public sector and a weak integration of Russian companies into global value chains have kept the Russian economy from collapsing. For coming years an expansion of Russia’s participation in manufacturing and services global value chains could offer the country long-term growth. This could help fulfill Russia’s National Goals aimed at developing exports of high-tech and agricultural goods, creating jobs in these sectors, and speeding up Russia’s technological development.\nThe World Bank predicts that due to more evident economic activity in the third quarter, Russia's GDP is projected to fall by 4% in 2020. Assuming the Sputnik V vaccine is safe and effective, consumer and business confidence can improve; this will set the base for a gradual return to economic growth with 2.6% in 2021 and 3% in 2022.\nThe AEB event \"The European Union & Russia: Allies? Partners? Rivals?\" had several exciting speakers that reflected on the relationship between Russia and the West. One of the speakers said that Russia does understand that China poses a risk to Russia's territorial integrity. It has chosen this cooperation anyway because China is considered not to be a threat to the current Russian political system; with the EU, it is currently the opposite.\nEven if few of the speakers could foresee this changing any time soon, it was mentioned that the rise of China might push the EU and perhaps the USA to cooperate more positively with Russia again. It was also said that NATO is gradually transforming from being an alliance against the Soviet Union to be an alliance against China. This might give a new opportunity for Russia and the West to start talking again about future cooperation. Another speaker highlighted that the EU remains Russia’s largest investor, ahead of both the USA and China.\nThe next election to the Russian State Duma will be held latest on the 19th of September. Currently, United Russia has a majority in the Duma.\nThere are a total of six parties in the Duma. President Putin commented during his annual marathon press conference: \"Up to 16 parties can take part in the election campaign next year. They have quite different points of view, but at the same time, practically each of them acts from a patriotic position. All have one goal: the well-being and development of the country.\" As Carnegie Moscow Centre recently pointed out in a research report, a big majority of Russian voters are conservative.\nOne could therefore expect more competition to United Russia in upcoming elections compared to earlier elections. ABC News noted that Putin in his press conference spoke positively about President Elect Joe Biden, describing him experienced in both domestic and foreign policy. Putin expressed hopes for a better relationship with the USA.\nSpain\nSpain has a very internationally integrated economy, primarily based on the tourism industry and the service sector. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the Spanish economy significantly, causing a GDP drop of -11% in the year 2020.\nNevertheless, Spanish government forecasts place expected GDP growth at between 2-4% for the year 2021.\nThe unemployment rate is extremely high (15.8% in 2020), but the figure is even larger for people under 35. Public debt is projected to skyrocket from 95% of GDP in 2019 to 117% in 2020 and 122% in 2021.\nAmong the companies which have been able to weather the storm more successfully are construction firms which have invested abroad, especially in the US and Latam ( i.e. Ferrovial, Acciona etc.), Pharmaceuticals (ROVI will manufacture the Moderna Vaccine for all of Europe in their laboratories at Madrid and Granada)\nIn the financial sector, to which The Taplow Group Spain has a great exposure, we have to point out how the Private Equity industry is also growing, raising funds to invest in special situations and restructuring. In the private banking and wealth management field, banks are also active, trying to expand their business due to the savings rate increase.\nSweden\nStatistics Sweden's new calculation of Sweden's GDP came during the third quarter of the year. GDP increased by 4.9 per cent compared with the second quarter, but the economy is far from recovering. During the second quarter, we saw a decrease of as much as 8.0 percent, the largest decrease between two quarters that has ever been measured.\nThe reduced economic activity has shocked the entire labour market. During the spring, the number of notices increased sharply and since March, 112,000 people have been notified of termination. In addition, 88,000 applications for short-term layoffs have been received by the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth and almost 600,000 employees have been covered by the system.\nThe strong impact on the labour market has been felt in most industries. The number of registered unemployed has increased to just over 450,000 people, an increase of 24 percent compared with the same period in the autumn of 2019.\nThe corona pandemic, and not least the advice and restrictions issued by the government and authorities, have resulted in a drop in demand that has hit the economy hard, but some industries have been affected more than others. One industry that has been hit particularly hard is the hotel and restaurant industry. According to the latest calculations from the\nNational Institute of Economic Research, the loss of turnover in the industry is currently 65 percent. In May 2020, 71 percent of industrial companies answered that they had lost sales. In the latest figures from the end of November, the level is 48 percent.\nIn trade, the situation is currently uncertain. After showing a steady recovery since May, the proportion of companies that now are experiencing a loss are increasing again. At the end of November, 57 per cent of companies in the trade answered that they had a loss in revenue, compared with 43 per cent in October.\nSeen across the entire business community, 55 per cent of all companies in the National Institute of Economic Research's survey answered that they have a loss of turnover compared with the same period last year. In May, that figure was 74 percent. A recovery is underway, but for many in Sweden the crisis is still very much present.\nWhat to expect for 2021?\nThe outlook for 2021 is that GDP will increase by 4.0% and the number of unemployed by 9.5%. As a country, Sweden is in a good position to handle the recession, as its level of public debt is among the lowest in Europe.\nAmong several measures, the economic recovery will be supported by a powerful green restart package. Extensive green investments in climate-neutral solutions in both industry and the public sector will lay the foundation for new jobs and strengthen the Swedish economy and competitiveness.\nThe forecasts show continued increased trade and changed buying habits of private individuals online. This means that continued growth will probably be demonstrated in various logistics solutions for retail and food.\nThe distribution of vaccines will support a better mood among both companies and consumers. We see a pent-up need for both consumption and investment. Hopefully, this will give a boost to both growth and the stock market in 2021.\nThere is a lot of discussion about the need for new skills within companies. New ways of working are necessary to meet the new Sweden after Covid-19 pandemic.\nWe will probably see a high demand for acquisitions and sales of companies.\nThe environment is a high priority issue. Both environmental impact from the own company and products that help reduce environmental impact.\nCompanies are working to become climate positive and thus companies in the green industry will continue to grow. Wind power, solar cells is large and will continue to grow in 2021.\nRegardless of what forecasts and speculations we make about 2021 in Sweden, everything will be dependent on the success of the vaccine distribution and to which extent the economic stimulus will continue.\nNote: References: SCB, konjunkturinstitutet, arbetsförmedlingen, government.se, ekonomifakta.se, DI.se\nUK\nThe OECD in its twice-yearly economic outlook, the Paris-based international organisation said that the world economy would on average regain the lost output from the Covid-19 crisis by the end of 2021, but the UK would be far behind the pack.\nTowards the end of next year, Britain’s economy would still be 6.4% smaller than it was in the fourth quarter of 2019, the OECD predicted. Output was now stalling at between 8 and 10 per cent below where it was in late 2019, the OECD said, highlighting the difficulty the UK would face in recovering quickly to the levels of economic performance, unemployment and living standards before the crisis.\nUnemployment is forecasted to rise further over 2021-22 as Government job support schemes end but is forecasted to slowly fall in the years following this.\nOverall, consumer confidence is forecasted to decline by 12% in 2020-21. Though future confidence levels depend on how long it takes for the pandemic to come under control, confidence is expected to quickly rebound, increasing by 11.2% in 2021-22 and continuing to grow over the next five years.\nAn emergency stimulus has helped to instil a degree of confidence among businesses. However, as trading conditions remain difficult and the prospect of imminent economic recovery is weak, business confidence remains low. As operations gradually return to normal, business confidence is expected to rebound from its current historic low in 2021-22 and continue to rise over the next five years.\nWe anticipate the healthcare, technology, logistics, financial services, and online service sectors to continue to show real growth in 2021 in the UK, whilst industries such as retail, hospitality and air travel will continue to see negative impact for some time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (4414)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "The Taplow Group – AMERICAS Region 2021 Business Outlook\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nMonday, December 21, 2020\n/\nCategories: \nNews\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we head towards the end of a tumultuous year and look towards 2021. Taplow partners across the globe have combined to give you local and regional insights on the business outlook for the new year.\nBrazil:\nAfter this year’s projected contraction due to the Covid-19 hit, the economy is likely to rebound strongly in 2021 as domestic and foreign demand recovers. However, the gradual reduction of fiscal stimulus as the coronavirus shock fades, an elevated unemployment rate and ballooning public debt represent downside risks to the outlook.\nAnalysts see the economy rebounding and growing 3.4% in 2021, which is down 0.1 percentage points from last month’s forecast. In 2022, forecasters predict GDP growth at 2.5%.\nData from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics’ monthly index tracking revenues from key services sectors reveals that despite a rebound in Q3, the index is still 9.7% below December 2019. Worst affected are accommodation and food services and air transport, given the difficulties of social distancing while eating out, staying in hotels, and traveling via a plane.\nCanada:\nRecovery from an output decline of 5.4% in 2020 will be muted by drag from regional restrictions to combat COVID-19 outbreaks and continued disruption to travel, hospitality and related sectors, leading to output growth of 3.5% in 2021. These developments will be echoed by a slow labour market recovery and low consumer price inflation. With vaccination against the virus set to become general in the latter half of 2021, diminished restrictions and a recovery in hard-hit sectors will support growth in 2022. Growth of the public debt burden will slow.\n \nFederal, provincial, and territorial Governments, along with the central bank, have been appropriately reactive to the evolving economic conditions. Going forward, Governments need greater emphasis on encouraging employment and business recovery through green investment and tackling long-standing structural issues that impede Canada’s business sector. Ensuring that the enhancement of employment insurance is adequate following the termination of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) also needs to be a priority. The Bank of Canada should stand ready to provide further liquidity support if required.\nUSA:\nNot to disparage anyone or any organization with a pessimistic or ultra conservative outlook, we note that cautious optimism seems to abound. The WFH trend will probably abate somewhat but as major firms are finding that knowledge workers are thriving and in some cases are far more productive, the number of days at the office is likely to remain lower for some-time or perhaps permanently.\nNot to be at all negative about the real estate needs, they may increase as distancing for safety may become institutionalized.\nWhile this may not appear to apply to those who require a multi-million-dollar laboratory or test facility to conduct research or test materials, we have differing observations. The reduction in the number of employees, including scientists and researchers who have to be on the laboratory floor has already decreased as more is done using data which is highly distributable. Those highly trained professionals are already very adept at using various data sharing and the possibility of data security breaches is already being addressed by the life sciences and other major research-oriented firms.\nThe threat of data breach is such that even our Governmental entities and suppliers to Government will enhance their use of security, which will require additional support – albeit with a pipeline of talent that may, dry-up very quickly.\nInvestment firms are likely to use various secure team communications more efficiently as will other high-level users of both human capital and technology. That will enhance the need to hire capable managers who can work in firms with very mixed understanding of technology utilization.\nOverall, we see roles changing at all levels. Virtual communications will be essential. We see Q1 as a ramp up in demand period with activity in some businesses for our services increasing by potentially 100% or more. The discussions we have been having suggest that demand for sales and marketing experts with high level technology backgrounds and scientific experience will increase steadily over the year.\nAlso related is the impact of the securities markets, if sustained, will drive retirements by many workers and result in increased demand for leaders and managers with more advanced behavioral and technology management/leadership skills to backfill what will possibly be a large number of internal promotions.\nVarious reporting services as well as white papers published by banks and investment managers as well as rating agencies seems marginally more optimistic. Unemployment amongst unskilled and lower skilled professionals is likely to remain a problem until both the pandemic and training deficiencies abate. This is likely to require increased but still cautious spending by private sector employers and by Government which could cause moderate increases in Government deficits and result in slightly increased taxes at local and national levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3485)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Taplow partners across the globe have combined to give you local and regional insights on the business outlook for the new year.\nAustralia:\nUnemployment is lower, GDP growth is higher, and like all countries the continued success for Australia is dependent on containing COVID-19. Consumer and business confidence are back at pre-COVID levels and 85% of the 1.3 million Australians who either lost their jobs, or saw their working hours reduced to zero, are now back at work.\nWith over 700,000 jobs created over the last six months, the labour market has performed better than expected. The September quarter saw an increase in GDP of 3.3%. This is the biggest quarterly rise since 1976. Real GDP is forecast to grow by 4.5% in 2021, following a reduction of 2.5% in 2020. There is optimism as Australia’s economic comeback is underway; ever since the COVID-19 pandemic began.\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs & Trade have been challenged with trying to bring over 39,000 Australians’ home. There has been considerable work that government officials have done to fulfil the Prime Minister’s Christmas hope to reunite Australian families. Finally, it is summer here and that means Cricket! Australia is hosting the Test Match Series with India as the visitors. Games have started and restricted crowds are attending.\nChina:\nThe Chinese economy was severely hit by the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Fortunately, due to strict control by using central power, the pandemic is under control. We expect the situation would be much better in 2021. Here are key points:\nAccording to Noruma’s forecast, partly due to a low base, GDP growth could surge to 9.0% y-o-y in 2021, from an estimated 2.1% in 2020. It is estimated that CPI inflation will stay below 2.0% y-o-y in 2021, implying neither disinflation nor inflation risk\nThanks for China’s relatively moderate stimulus to cope with the pandemic which reduces the need for deleveraging in 2021. An elevated current account surplus, a strong RMB and low inflation build up the solid base to deal with financial risks\nIf China is not hit by a serious second wave of COVID-19, a modest slowdown approach may be used in credit growth. China will target to contain the rise in interest rates and funding costs to sustain the growth recovery.\n \nDue to Covid-19, the life science industry is booming in 2020 and will continue this trend in 2021 especially biotech industry. Internet hospital and healthcare industry would also be developed under China’s strategy. The trade restriction and tension set by Trump Government may be eased in 2021. However, high tech export restriction and punishment on semiconductor chip may push China to develop its own semiconductor chip industry and put more resource on basic research to diminish the reliance on the technology importation. Clean energy industry could also be booming to ensure China’s fulfillment to the obligation to Paris Agreement.\nIndia:\nIndia could well be the fastest-growing Asian economy in calendar year 2021 (CY21) if Nomura’s forecasts are to be believed. The foreign research and brokerage house expects the Indian economy – as measured by gross domestic product (GDP) – to grow at 9.9 per cent in 2021, eclipsing China (2021 GDP growth pegged at 9 per cent) and Singapore (at 7.5 per cent) during this period.\nAt a macro level, Nomura expects global growth to pick up from negative 3.7 per cent in 2020 to 5.6 per cent in 2021, with growth in H1-2021 averaging around 7.8 per cent y-o-y (owing to base effect). It expects inflation to average at around 5.5 per cent in H1-2021, before easing to 4.1 per cent in the second half.\nKey risks\nThe fastest-growing tag in 2021, however, will come with its own challenges. A key concern in 2021 and beyond, Nomura said, is the implication of the K-shaped recovery seen till now. A slower pace of recovery in the informal sector, according to them, implies the cyclical recovery maybe a jobless recovery and can lead to lower per-capita income, higher inequality, pressure for more populist spending by the Government and social tensions.\nA rise in infection cases due to crowding during recent festivals; fading of pent-up demand after the initial reflex; fiscal drag from expenditure compression in Q1, as the Government struggles to keep the deficit under control; and weaker growth in Europe and the US due to the pandemic are the four risks it cites that could trigger a slowdown in economic growth going ahead.\nAccording to Moody’s Investor Service India’s rated nonfinancial companies are predicted to have a “stable” outlook in 2021. Companies would see their earnings grow as demand starts to recover, following a sharp drop over the last two quarters. A structural shift in consumption patterns would support demand growth over the next 12 to 18 months.\nMoody’s Prediction\nOil and gas: Margins and business conditions in this sector will be more subdued than before the pandemic began.\nTelecommunications: The sector’s profitability has rebounded due to tariff hikes that increased average revenue per user, according to Moody’s. 5G spectrum auction prices are likely to be expensive\nAutomobile manufacturers and suppliers: Auto sales are expected to modestly increase in 2021 and beyond based on pent-up demand as well as fresh demand for entry-level vehicles since consumers are likely to focus on safe distancing.\nSteel: Steel production is set to resume gradually following the national lockdown. Consumption is predicted to rise by a “low-single-digit percentage” in fiscal year 2022.\nMining: The ratings agency predicted a stable global industry outlook for the mining sector would reflect better business conditions and rising production levels that would improve profitability among Indian companies.\nRBI Outlook\nRBI predicts Indian economy has stopped shrinking in the October-December quarter projecting a GDP growth of 0.1 per cent in Q3 and 0.7 per cent in Q4 January-March of 2021. The central bank also revised its estimate for economic contraction during FY21 to 7.5 per cent from the earlier assessment on 9.5 per cent. The central bank, however, cautioned that the positive assessment depends a great deal on the spread of coronavirus in coming days and progress on vaccine development front.\nThe Reserve Bank of India has also been careful about cutting its policy rate, especially as higher inflation has pushed real rates to exceptionally low levels.\nMarket size\nIndia’s GDP (at constant 2011-12 prices) was estimated at Rs 26.9 trillion (US$ 363.49 billion) for the first quarter of FY2020-21, against Rs 35.35 trillion (US$ 477.67 billion) in the first quarter of FY2019-20, showing a contraction of 23.9%, compared with 5.2% growth in the first quarter of FY2019-20.\nIndia is the fourth-largest unicorn base in the world with over 21 unicorns collectively valued at US$ 73.2 billion, as per the Hurun Global Unicorn List. By 2025, India is expected to have ~100 unicorns by 2025 and will create ~1.1 million direct jobs according to the Nasscom-Zinnov report ‘Indian Tech Start-up’.\nIndia's foreign exchange reserve was Rs 39 .64 trillion (US$ 542.01 billion) in the week up to September 4, 2020 according to data from the RBI.\nGovernment Initiatives\nThe first Union Budget of the third decade of 21st century was presented by Minister for Finance & Corporate Affairs, Ms Nirmala Sitharaman in the Parliament on February 1, 2020. The budget aimed at energising the Indian economy through a combination of short-term, medium-term, and long-term measures. Total expenditure for 2020-21 is budgeted at Rs 37.14 trillion (US$ 531.53 billion), an increase of 13% from 2019-20 (revised budget estimates).\nThe Government of India, under its Make in India initiative, is trying to boost the contribution made by the manufacturing sector with an aim to take it to 25% of the GDP from the current 17%. Besides, the Government has also come up with Digital India initiative, which focuses on three core components: creation of digital infrastructure, delivering services digitally and to increase the digital literacy.\nRoad Ahead\nIndia's GDP is expected to reach US$ 5 trillion by FY25 and achieve upper-middle income status on the back of digitization, globalization, favourable demographics, and reforms.\nIndia is also focusing on renewable sources to generate energy. It is planning to achieve 40% of its energy from non-fossil sources by 2030, which is currently 30%, and have plans to increase its renewable energy capacity from to 175 gigawatt (GW) by 2022.\nIndia is expected to be the third largest consumer economy as its consumption may triple to US$ 4 trillion by 2025, owing to shift in consumer behaviour and expenditure pattern, according to a Boston Consulting Group (BCG) report.\nIndia is expected to attract investment of around US$ 100 billion in developing the oil and gas infrastructure during 2019-23.\nNew Zealand:\nIt is noticeably clear from discussions both business and personal that 2020 is a year that many people will be quite keen to put behind them. There is no doubt that it has been a challenging year for everyone, but it is also a year where the New Zealand economy has shown resilience in the face of one of the biggest shocks in modern history.\nThe latest forecasts have the economy ending 2020 3% smaller than it finished 2019 which is a fantastic result given the situation the country has been through. New Zealand has just released the GDP figures for Q3 of 2020 which showed an increase in 14% off the back of an equally record-setting 11.0% decline in activity in Q2. The great news is that by the end of the September quarter, activity in the New Zealand economy had surpassed pre-Covid levels. Six months ago, it was predicted it would take until 2023 to achieve this.\nThis outcome reflects the sheer degree of support the economy has received, the relatively quick exit from lockdown, and the readiness that people have reached for their wallets or tapped out transactions on their phones. Fear of losing jobs has quickly given way to fear of missing out on a bargain or some fun.\nTourism\nNew Zealand’s biggest revenue earner pre Covid-19 was the Tourism sector. This took a massive hit when the New Zealand border closed in late March 2020. New modelling shows that while domestic tourism is unlikely to completely fill the gap left by international visitors, it will help to partially sustain the sector while it recovers to pre-Covid-19 levels over the next two to three years.\nBased on modelling undertaken by Tourism New Zealand, the biggest opportunities and risks for the tourism sector’s recovery over the next few years are:\nTrans-Tasman (New Zealand/Australia) border re-opening – there is a potential window for this to occur by March 2021 however this will depend on bilateral health outcomes and trade negotiations. There are also travel bubbles being discussed with Rarotonga and Niue.\nRest of world borders re-opening, which will also depend on global health outcomes and trade negotiations\nDemand pacing, consumer confidence and strength of ‘pacing’ or demand uptake in the months that follow domestic alert levels and/or international border re-openings\nBusinesses ability to survive, pivot and compete for a bigger share of Kiwi consumers’ holiday spend, converting outbound holiday spend into domestic tourism value\nTransport\nFreight is still reaching New Zealand ports and our primary produce is being loaded for export markets. Coastal shipping is still operating as normal. China is coming back on line with all ports operating and controls over people movements being reduced. Food is being provided priority clearance in China, however there is uncertainty with respect to markets where Covid-19 is starting to take hold and borders are being closed. New Zealand relies on exports for GDP and the impact of less air freight options is certainly challenging to our export sector.\nIn General\nLocally, the debate has quickly turned to the strength of the New Zealand housing market, which is helping to tow consumer spending along, and whether or not interest rates will or should go lower. Households don’t need even lower interest rates to encourage them to spend more money and buy houses at present – they have jumped the starter’s gun on that one (an increase in house values year on year of 25% is generally being seen).\nAccording to one large New Zealand Bank, they no longer see a negative Official Cash Rate as necessary, given the strong household response to date to low interest rates as well as the roll-out of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s Funding for Lending Programme (FLP). The FLP will help to keep a lid on bank funding costs, though against a backdrop of recent rebounds in wholesale interest rates as the hot housing market and the increasingly level of government concern about housing get digested. The silver lining is: it’s better to see the economy responding to low interest rates than not – that would be a much bigger problem to cope with.\nThe job market continues to be indifferent depending on which city you reside in. Wellington, the capital city and home to Government has had a roller coaster but overall a positive year, however the same cannot be said for other cities. Big hits continue to occur in Auckland (New Zealand’s largest city) and Christchurch, and it will take them longer to try and return to a new norm. Expectations are that the latter two will bounce back eventually, however the pressure may come on Government to cut spending to commence repayment of what has been significant handouts in 2020 because of Covid-19 which could potentially impact the Wellington market.\nSingapore:\nSingapore will be moving into Phase 3 reopening on Dec 28th, 2020. This was the news many Singaporeans and businesses were eagerly anticipating moving into 2021.\nWhile Singapore is still a recession and economists suggesting that the economy may contract by as much as 5%, the Singapore Government has pledged to support businesses and citizens through to June 2021 with various grants to soften the impact of Covid-19 and help them recover in 2021.\nOn the employment front, the Singapore Government has proactively worked with the private sector to create job opportunities for Singaporeans who were retrenched. This has kept the unemployment numbers down to near pre COVID-19 levels.\nSectors such as tourism and air travel will continue to lag going into 2021 as the rest of the region struggle to contain the pandemic. The construction sector continues to be marred by delays due to construction labour crunch and shortage in materials.\nWe will continue to see investments in advanced technologies R&D such as AI, ICT and big data. With companies such as Hyundai Motor Group, Zoom, Tencent, Infineon committing to making Singapore a strategic innovation hub for their businesses.\nOther sectors such as Lifesciences, Pharmaceutical, Logistics have enjoyed sustained growth in 2020 and will continue well into 2021. Singapore is proactively taking steps to restart business travel with other countries through various air bubble initiatives and easing travel restrictions as the vaccine is being rolled out.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3277)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Hence, every business needs significant attention and thought process to develop their HR strategies. But for most organizations, HR is not their core strength. At the same time, one cannot ignore it or outsource it completely to some external organization. The best way is to engage with those who have years of experience working with different clients across industries and geographies. In short – hire a \n human resource consulting firm\n for your business.\n\n\n\n\nLet us take a look at the benefits of partnering with an HR consulting firm:\n\n\n\n\nOutsourcing HR activities\n\r\nOnce you connect with an HR consulting firm, you can outsource most HR functions to your external partner. This would reduce the burden on your HR team, save you time and money, and help you focus your attention on your core business activities. \n HR Consulting firms\n would take care of all the requirements in the most comprehensive manner.\n\n\n\n\nBring experience and expertise to the table\n\r\nHR consultants have years of experience working for different industries and businesses. They understand the dynamics and map the perfect candidate or build the best HR strategy for your business. These experts know the best practices across talent management, talent engagement, performance management, and likewise. Hence, you bring on board a lot of expertise when you partner with an\n \n HR consulting firm.\n\n\n\n\nHR Tech Knowhow\n\r\nTechnology is on its way to disrupt everything, and HR functions and activities are no exceptions. It is a daunting task for your HR folks to know and keep themselves updated with the latest disruptions in the field of HR functions. These external \n HR consultants \n have thorough knowledge about the tech and the tools, and they would help your employees in the implementation part of HR tech. They would be responsible for maintaining, upgrading, and training your employees to use tools and software.\n\n\n\n\nReduce Compliance issues\n\r\nThe HR consultants are more aware of the laws and regulations related to labor and HR activities. They would keep a tab on these regulations and would continue to update your HR policies accordingly. Labor laws vary from one country to another; even across a country, it might vary from one state to another. For an organization operating in different states and countries, it is imperative to be in tandem with the land regulations. Having HR consultants onboard makes your organization compliant and reduces risks and penalties for non-compliance.\n\n\n\n\nEmployee Benefits\n\r\nAn \n HR consulting firm\n \nwill help you analyze the overall attitude and perception of your employees. It would help you design benefit and engagement programs in line with the expectations of your employees. This would go a long way in improving performance and employee retention. HR consultants can also study existing policies and revise them according to the industry's best practices.\n\n\n\r\nThe \n human resource requirement\n \nwould vary from organization to organization and an HR consulting firm is fully equipped to handle such requirements. You would improve your HR strategies and employee engagement when you partner with an HR consulting firm, so it’s a win –win situation all the way!\n\n\n\r\nAt The Taplow Group we help you source the best-fit for your organization’s leadership through our \n executive search consultants.\n To know more about our services like leadership coaching, professional hiring, management consulting, reach out to us at \n www.taplowgroup.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (7628)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\nTags: \nexecutive search consultants \nhuman resource consulting firm \nHR consulting firm \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Now, you would not always get the best and the brightest right at your doorstep, right? Organizations are thinking globally while making their hiring decisions, and this is where our\n global executive search services\n \nwould ensure your success. Our recruitment strategists will help you identify and hire the best talent across the world.

Our consultants have vast experience, access to multiple markets, and a thorough understanding of your business and culture. The context-driven approach stands on certain principles –\n\n\n\n\nA plan before we start\n\r\nOur \n global executive search consultants\n always plan ahead of time.

We do our homework thoroughly and stay ahead of the curve at all times.\n\n\n\n\nThorough knowledge about regional markets\n\r\nIt is a daunting task for an organization to be familiar with all the world's regional markets.

This gives a clear insight and helps us match the right talent to your organization's open position.\n\n\n\n\nWe help you build your value proposition\n\r\nDon't be mistaken; it is not your product's or business' value proposition.

This is not a one size fits all kind of solution. Every position will have a different proposition, which might alter based on the work culture in a particular geography.\n\n\n\n\nRobust selection process\n\r\nOnce the hiring strategy is in place, we design the selection process.

Although the rollout of vaccines is dependant on governments having initially pre-ordered the successful vaccines, there is still concern about certain regions being able to afford or effectively distribute the vaccine to allow their economies to bounce back.\n\n\n\n\nExecutives:\n\r\nLocal focus is the key to companies’ executives understanding the impact on their businesses through the end of the year and into Q1 of 2021.Knowledge of what is happening on the ground enables successful strategies being rolled out.\n\n\n\n\nEmployees:\n\r\nUncertainty of Covid regulations coupled with fast changing strategies is causing stress within the workforce. Employees are often on the front line of implementation of strategies and require clear and concise communication.\n\n\n\n\nAFRICA\n\r\nAs Sub-Saharan African countries have managed to keep the COVID-19 virus (coronavirus) under control with relatively low number of cases, the pandemic continues to take a toll on African lives and economies. Economic activity is projected to decline by 3.3% in 2020, confirming the region’s first recession in 25 years. The substantial downturn in economic activity will cost the region at least $115 billion in output losses this year, in part caused by lower domestic consumption and investment brought on by containment measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Below are key points from our partners in each country.\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa\n\r\nSouth Africa’s economy is expected to bounce back in the third quarter of the year – with finance group BNP Paribas even expecting things will work out better than the South African Reserve Bank expects. Q4 growth performance is now also more subdued at +1% q/q, and indicates an economy, which still looks likely to contract 8% in 2020.\n\n\n\r\nAfter this year’s projected contraction at the hands of Covid-19, the economy is seen to be rebounding in 2021 as domestic and foreign demand revive. That said, high unemployment and persistent electricity shortages are likely to weigh on growth, while frail fiscal metrics and a ballooning public debt stock pose additional risks. Focus economics panellists see the economy expanding 3.6% in 2021, which is down 0.1 percentage points from last month’s forecast, and 2.5% in 2022.\n\n\n\n\nASIA \n\r\nThe region as a whole is expected to grow by only 0.9 percent in 2020, the lowest rate since 1967. While China is forecasted to grow by 2.0 percent in 2020 – boosted by government spending, strong exports, and a low rate of new COVID-19 infections since March, but checked by slow domestic consumption – the rest of the EAP region is projected to contract by 3.5 percent. Below are key points from our partners in numerous countries in the region.\n\n\n\n\nAustralia \n\r\nIn Australia, conditions continue to improve across the nation from a COVID-19 pandemic perspective and from a markets and consumer sentiment perspective. Consumer sentiment jumped a further 2.5% in November, leaving the headline index at its highest level since late 2013. High frequency payrolls and housing data were also robust and consensus forecasts for Australian GDP growth in 2021 are now starting to move higher. (Source: Bloomberg and JBWere. Sally Auld Chief Investment Officer, JB Were.) Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance.\n\n\n\r\nDomestic travel options continue to open up in Australia to all regions without quarantine restrictions and the frequency of air travel is increasing. The return of office workers to Central Business Districts is being staged in most major cities with strict guidelines for use of public transport, social distancing and hygiene protocols including masks and sanitiser use. International returns of Australian citizens are also being increased with Victoria likely to once again open its international gateway in December adding to the other gateways already open.\n\n\n\n\nIndia\n\r\nIndia's IT and business services market is expected to increase by 5.4% annually to reach US$ 13 billion, research firm IDC said.\n\n\n\r\nA new study reported that in 2020 mobile phone exports in India are expected to record the highest shipments ever of US$1.5 billion by value, out of which 98% will be smartphones.\n\n\n\r\nFlipkart Group, including Myntra, dominated as India’s online retailers clocked a 65% jump in gross merchandise value (GMV) during festive season sales this year. This year’s festive sales saw 88% customer growth from last year, as close to 40 million shoppers from tier-2 and beyond cities tapped e-commerce platforms\n\n\n\r\nThe Internal Working Group of RBI (Reserve Bank of India) has suggested opening banking systems to large Corporate & Industrial Houses, as promoters of Private Banks. This report by IWG has led to a lot of discussion in the market, with as many critics as well as supporters.\n\n\n\r\nDigital Payments: Approximately US$270.7 billion in transactions worth US$66.6 billion are projected to move from cash to cards and digital payments in India by 2023 and expand further to US$856.6 billion by 2030, Accenture said on Tuesday.\n\n\n\r\nIndia may attract US$120-160 billion per year of foreign direct investment (FDI) by 2025, leading to an increase in the ratio of FDI to GDP from 3-4% to less than 2%, CII and EY researchers reported. Over the past 10 years, the country has seen GDP rise 6.8%, with FDI increasing to GDP at 1.8%. It reported that in terms of attractiveness, investors ranked India third, at least 80% have plans to invest in India in the next two to three years, and nearly 25% reported investments worth more than US$ 500 million, The Economic Times reported.\n\n\n\n\nSingapore\n\r\nSingapore’s economy is expected to shrink between 6 per cent and 6.5 per cent this year. However, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore managed to secure S$13 billion worth of fixed asset investment commitments in the first four months of 2020. That was among the highest in recent years and reflected businesses’ confidence in Singapore’s “high levels of connectivity, openness, and brand of trust”, according to the latest public sector report released.\n\n\n\r\nSingapore also continued to be highly regarded as a place to do business. This year, the country ranked second in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index, after consistently placing in the top three for the past 14 years. Singapore was ranked among the world’s most competitive economies by the World Economic Forum in 2019, and by the International Institute for Management Development (IIMD) in 2020. This year, it was also the only Asian country in the top 10 of the IIMD’s world talent ranking.\n\n\n\r\nStreamlined regulations and improved government to business (G2B) services make it easy to start and grow a business, as well as pursue innovation. It takes only 1.5 days to start a business in Singapore.\n\n\n\r\nCompanies and banks will soon get more support to obtain and develop green and sustainable financing under a new scheme by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).\n\r\nThe Green and Sustainability-Linked Loan Grant Scheme (GSLS), announced on Tuesday (Nov 24), will take effect from Jan 1 next year. Describing the GSLS as \"the first of its kind globally\",MAS said in a media release that it seeks to support companies of all sizes to obtain green and sustainable financing.\n\n\n\r\nUnder the scheme, MAS will defray up to S$100,000 of the expenses that companies incur to validate the green and sustainability credentials of a loan. This includes expenses to engage independent sustainability assessment and advisory service providers to develop green and sustainability frameworks and targets, obtain external reviews and report on the sustainability impact of a loan.It will defray up to 60 per cent of expenses, capped at S$120,000, incurred by banks to engage independent sustainability assessment and advisory service providers, obtain external reviews and report on the allocated proceeds of loans originated under the framework.\n\r\n \n\n\nNew Zealand\n\r\nTourism exports normally account for around 5% of GDP, and the halt on tourist inflows since March has been a significant drag on earnings and employment in sectors like accommodation and hospitality. In contrast, outside of the travel and tourism sectors, much of the ground lost earlier in the year has already been recovered, with many parts of the domestic economy rebounding faster than expected after the lockdown. At the head of the pack, businesses linked to the building industry are reporting strong demand. There have also been lifts in manufacturing activity (including exports) and gains in the retail sector. Against this backdrop and on a positive note, there seems to be a rise in the number of businesses who are planning to take on new staff.\n\n\n\r\nCovid-related support spending is now winding down, but there will be ongoing increases in general Government spending and huge infrastructure investment over the coming years. There is a public appetite for fiscal spending to tackle a wide range of social concerns, including child poverty, access to housing, and the provision of both health and education services.\n\n\n\r\nHelping to boost households’ spending appetites has been the roaring strength of the housing market, which has defied expectations for a significant downturn in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. When the economy first went into lockdown most of New Zealand’s major banks forecasted that house prices would initially fall by up to 7% and would later shoot higher in response to low interest rates. However, what occurred was a decline of only 2% followed by an earlier and bigger boom, with prices now up a whopping 14% over the past year.\n\n\n\n\nEUROPE\n\r\nThe region’s predicted “2nd wave” of Covid19 is here as the winter starts. A number of key countries have announced either complete lockdown or regional lockdowns that will undoubtedly weaken the return to economic growth, The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in European Union contracted 4.30 percent in the third quarter of 2020 over the same quarter of the previous year. Below are key points from our partners in numerous countries in the region.\n\n\n\n\nFrance\n\r\nMost of the macroeconomic figures for the third quarter of 2020 are now available. They retrace, with those of the second quarter, an unprecedented sequence in which a large part of the economy came to a standstill before starting up again. The rebound was strong. The French GDP grew by 18.2% in the third quarter compared with the second, bringing the year-on-year change to -4.3% (compared with -18.9% in the previous quarter). This major swing took place over a fairly short period of time, i.e. the bulk of the rebound took place in May and June, even before the start of the third quarter. It was encouraged by an economic policy aimed, via the increase in public debt, at preserving as far as possible the productive fabric and household incomes. The partial activity scheme has allowed employment to fall much less than the volume of paid work since last March.\n\n\n\r\nThe second wave of the pandemic and the 2nd lockdown of the population are nevertheless thwarting this rebound and changing the temporality of the crisis. The contraction of private sector activity in France worsened in November as the French government tightened containment measures to stem the spread of the Covid-19 epidemic, according to preliminary data released by IHS Markit.\n\n\n\r\nFrance's composite PMI index (i.e. Purchasing Managers’ Index) fell to 39.9 in November, its lowest level in six months, from 47.5 in October. A figure above 50 indicates an expansion of activity compared to the previous month, while a figure below 50 indicates a decline. In detail, the PMI index for the services sector fell to 38 in November, its lowest level in six months, after 46.5 in October. The PMI index for the manufacturing sector also fell to 49.1, its lowest level in six months as well, after 51.3 in October.\n\n\n\r\nBeyond the contraction in GDP now expected in the fourth quarter, it is now quite likely that the health and economic situations will continue to be linked, for at least the first half of 2021. The expectations of economic players are therefore adapting accordingly. The prospect of a vaccine, if it materialises, suggests however that the horizon for the end of the health crisis may be drawing nearer.\n\n\n\n\nFinland \n\r\nGDP is up 2.5% in Q3 after 4.5% down in the previous quarter so there is some financial recovery in place. However, the new restrictions and second wave of Covid-19 will have its effect. No major drops in employment rate yet.\n\n\n\r\nCovid-19 situation in Finland is still among the best in Europe but getting worse and we are applying new restrictions. In Finland, people are rather compliant towards authorities and regulations which can be seen in wearing masks and trying to keep social distance.\n\n\n\r\nEven though the pandemic situation is as serious or even worse than in spring, there is a big threshold in closing the restaurants or gyms etc. Success of the winter season in Lapland is crucial for the whole travel industry and is now based on domestic travel only. National airline company Finnair is relying heavily on owners’ help to get through the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\nGermany\n\r\nAfter the corona recession, the economic experts are expecting significant growth again in the coming year (GDP +3.7%). For 2020, they expect a decrease of only 5.1%. However, due to the increasing number of infections, experts still see many risks. The prospect of a corona vaccine improves the chances for a faster economic recovery.\n\n\n\r\nGDP for Germany Q2, -10.1% compared to Q1; Q3, +8.2% compared to Q2 (-4.1% compared to Q3 2019). The unemployment rate fell from September to October by 0.2% to 6.0%. The use of short-time work continues to decline. However, there are still clear signs of the first wave of the corona pandemic on the labour market.\n\n\n\r\nBusiness Advisory – Market Entry and Growth Opportunities for Tech-SMEs\n\r\nWe stand for Strategic Consulting and Executive Search. Together with selected experts we offer a holistic approach tailored to our clients' international strategy and growth opportunities.\n\n\n\r\nIn Q4 2019 Taplow (Germany) started a new initiative focusing on the fast-developing sector of climate-relevant and environmental technologies and is now profiting from initial consulting projects.\n\n\n\r\nAccording to the ideas of the federal states, the protection rules in force until the end of November are to be extended for the time being until December 20 and in some cases tightened. For example, private meetings will be restricted to five persons from a maximum of two households. However, this is to be relaxed from Christmas to New Year.\n\n\n\n\nNorway\n\r\nBusiness in Norway is still improving halfway into Q4. Gross National Product for the year is however expected to be down between 5 and 8%. Current unemployment is about 6.6%, up from 3.1% in 2019.\n\n\n\r\n‘Semi-lock-down’ - Most businesses go as usual, but large corporations are encouraged to let as many as possible to work from home. Restaurants and bars are not able to serve alcohol after 23:59, and not allowed to let new guests in after 22:00\n\r\nGenerally, travel and tourism is hurt badly. Norwegian Airline, with almost 200 aircrafts and 15,000 employees has filed ‘chapter11’. Elementary Schools are functioning as usual. High-Schools are following one week on, and one week off campus routine.\n\n\n\n\nRussia\n\r\nThe Russian government approved the increase of income tax to 15% on annual salaries larger than RUB5 million. Before, the income tax was only 13% on all wages regardless of income level.\n\n\n\r\nThe government prolonged the pandemic regime until January 1st, 2022. For businesses, it means that all extended sanitary norms will continue to be obligatory - extra cleaning and disinfection, providing employees with masks, gloves, and sanitizers all next year. Therefore, we can assume that instead many companies will keep the remote working regime or a combination of home and office work. In Moscow a minimum of 30% of employees must work from home until January 15th, 2021, and companies try to rotate them.\n\n\n\r\nThe Russian retail sector has experienced a very heterogeneous development during 2020. Smaller stores, malls and local fashion retailers faced a high decrease in their sales volumes. At the same time, online retail is booming, and hypermarkets are reporting a record year in their sales and number of visitors.\n\n\n\r\nThis development is not only related to lockdowns but mainly to the changing consumer behaviour during the pandemic. Consumers prefer to visit fewer stores but with bigger space, to keep distances and buy all necessities in one place.\n\n\n\r\nAnother remarkable development we can see in the HORECA and tourism industry. These sectors have been hit hard around Russia, except for the Krasnodar Region, particularly the city of Sochi, which had seen higher numbers of visitors in summer than during the 2014 Olympics and tour bookings increased by 121% compared to last year. Yet, increased numbers of visitors resulted in increasing coronavirus infections and now during the winter months occupation of hotels and resorts is at only 68% of their capacity.\n\n\n\r\nAn IMF statement says that Russia’s strong fiscal, monetary, and macro-prudential response to the crisis helped put a floor under the downturn and fostered a stronger-than-projected rebound of third-quarter GDP. IMF experts project the Russian economy to contract by about 4% this year, and to expand by some 2.5% in 2021, assuming the COVID-19 situation gradually normalises.\n\n\n\n\nUK\n\r\nThe UK economy recovered in Q3 2020 with its largest ever increase in GDP. UK GDP grew\n\r\nby 15.5% in Quarter 3 (Jul to Sep) 2020. In September, monthly GDP was 8.2% lower than the levels seen in February 2020, before the full impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\n\r\nQ4 will see a contraction due to the national 1-month lockdown that ends on December 2nd and will be replaced by a severe 3-tier system that will see 99% of the UK citizens having restrictions imposed on them.\n\n\n\r\nJanuary 1st 2021 sees the Brexit negotiating period coming to an end. Although the EU and UK governments are still negotiating and say a Brexit trade deal is close, timeframes to conclude matters keep shifting and businesses are planning for a “no deal” outcome that would see the UK trading in Europe under WTO rules, but businesses still want and hope for a trade deal to be signed in December.\n\n\n\r\nThe services sector remains 8.8% lower than the level in February 2020, before the main impacts of the coronavirus were seen. The production sector remains 5.6% lower than the level in February 2020, before the main impacts of the coronavirus were seen.\n\n\n\n\nAMERICAS\n\r\nThe Americas and particularly regions in the USA are continuing to see uncertainty of the pandemic and elections also created economic stagnation. Although the USA continues to show economic recovery, it is showing signs of increasing infection rates and uncertainty about how countries tackle the issue. Below are key points from our partners in numerous countries in the region.\n\n\n\n\nSouth America\n\r\nThe continent is dealing with the pandemic from a weak economic base. Countries are adopting a variety of measures, but many countries are unable to effectively support businesses and this will no doubt lead to an increase in unemployment.\n\n\n\n\nBrazil\n\r\nBrazil slipped into recession in the second quarter of 2020 as the spread of COVID-19 across the country not only weighed on economic activity but also people’s worries about contracting the virus, social distancing measures, and a deterioration in the labour market affected consumer spending in Q2. The pandemic and its economic impact so far have also added to the uncertainty for businesses that have cut down on investment spending. While fiscal stimulus and monetary easing have aided a nascent economic recovery in Q3, it is too early to say whether there will be any swift upward movement in growth.\n\n\n\r\nThe economy contracted for the second successive quarter in Q2 2020 as the spread of COVID-19 hit consumer spending and business investment. Real GDP fell by 9.7% in the second quarter compared to the previous one with domestic demand declining by 12.7%. Compared to a year ago, real GDP was down 11.4% in Q2. Monthly data on key indicators suggest that a recovery is currently underway. Manufacturing, for example, has been recovering after a sharp contraction in April and May.\n\n\n\n\nCanada\n\r\nCanada's economic outlook for 2020 is improving slightly because of growth in the real estate market, residential investment, and household consumption, although a number of factors that contributed to the 2019 slowdown remain. As a result of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, the gross domestic product (GDP) of Canada is projected to decline 5.6% in 2020.\n\n\n\r\nThe business index represents the most accurate measure of business confidence in Canada. More specifically, a value of 0.0 indicates completely neutral business sentiment, with lower and higher values respectively corresponding to negative and positive perceptions of the business environment in Canada. In 2020, the index is projected to have a value of -2.3.\n\n\n\r\nThis index considers a variety of operating conditions for businesses, including business activity, pressures on production capacity, price trends and credit conditions. In 2020, the index is projected to decline a staggering 8,427.3% as coronavirus cases are once again on the rise in Canada, thus reflecting widespread negative business confidence as the resumption of normal business operations may be delayed further.\n\n\n\n\nUSA\n\r\nAnnual US GDP is projected to decline 4.4% in 2020 due to the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This would be the first decline since 2009 and the worst decline since 1946. Even though a coronavirus vaccine is expected in the first half of 2021, the economy will likely take time to recover to pre-pandemic levels and uncertainty with consumer behaviour will likely remain.\n\n\n\r\nDespite continuing economic concerns and the reluctance of our President to accept the outcome of the election, the US business community remains optimistic about growth as the vaccines are apparently about to be distributed in the US market. Despite the obvious loss in the election, President Trump continues to foster conspiracy theories and is trying to influence the “Electors” from each state to vote for him rather than vote the results of the vote in their state. We have not seen such an effort previously, but it is doubtful the courts, even the judges selected by the current administration will support that notion.\n\n\n\r\nWe hope that you, your family, and work colleagues continue to stay healthy and safe. We at The Taplow Group are here to support you and your business through this crisis. We will be back with another update soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3379)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Chief Executive Officer is the highest-ranking and the most sought-after title in the executive world. A CEO is responsible for making strategic decisions, managing the overall business processes, connecting with the shareholders, and acting as the public image of an organization.\nHiring or recruitment the right person as a CEO is a mammoth task. Hence, it is wise to opt for \n CEO Search Services\n to scout and find the leader who would take charge of the organization.

It also can involve mergers and acquisitions, capital expenditures, and divestitures.\nOrganizational Alignment\nTalented CEOs focus on all the elements that drive performance in an organization. As a CEO, one has to go beyond employee engagement and match talent with roles that generate the best value. Excellent CEOs create a dynamic and agile environment, promoting knowledge sharing and growth, increasing the company's corporate IQ.\nBoard Engagement\nEffective CEOs always leverage the expertise of the board members. It goes beyond board meetings, as the CEO would take input from members on important strategic decisions of the company otherwise as well.\n \nTeams and Processes\nA successful CEO would always emphasize more on the dynamics than on the mechanics of teams and processes. The CEO is responsible for bringing coherence in teams, resolving conflicts effectively, and removing all kinds of biases and discriminations within the organization.\nExternal Stakeholders\nCEOs think beyond business and profits and focus on the impact that the company is making on society. They think about the ‘Why’ of a company’s existence, the bigger picture, and ensures that the company is working towards changing lives.\n \nPersonal world and norms:\nEven the most effective CEOs could become overwhelmed because of their working domains' sheer length and depth. To be more effective at work, every CEO should have a world of thier own, with certain norms and working rules.\nCEO Search – Enhanced\nWith excellent and result-oriented CEO search services, your CEO search process is now enhanced. CEO recruiters start by developing a full understanding your business requirements and visions for a CEO. Once the profile is developed, they set out preparing an outreach program.

    "content": "Taplow Group – 10th 2020 Global Business Overview\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nMonday, November 2, 2020\n/\nCategories: \nNews\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nThe global pandemic has seen businesses affected across every sector, in all parts of the world. Taplow partners across the globe have combined to give you the local and regional insights.\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings\n\n\n\r\n• \nCompanies\n - Companies are struggling with fast changing and fluid local and countrywide Government regulations. These changes are likely to pick up speed over the next 3 to 6 months, particularly in the northern hemisphere as the winter approaches.\n\n\n\r\n• \nExecutives\n - Once again Working from Home (WFH) is becoming the norm, many creative orientated teams are suffering through lack of interaction. Executives are also grappling with the fast-evolving government regulations.\n\n\n\r\n• \nEmployees\n - Mental health and welfare issues are coming to the fore as government services deal with the pandemic. WFH also brings loneliness and anxiety issues to the fore.\n\n\n\n\nAFRICA\n\r\nAccording to a survey by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Internet penetration in sub-Saharan Africa has grown tenfold, over the last 20 years. This means that sectors like ICT, finance and insurance, the public sector, education, and retail trade are indeed perfectly poised to grow swiftly as the pandemic drives digitization.\n\n\n\n\nSouth Africa\n\r\nThe South African Government has confirmed another big bailout for the country's struggling national airline. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said $640m (£492m) would enable South African Airways to implement a rescue plan.\n\n\n\r\nSouth Africa's President, Cyril Ramaphosa, has dismissed \"alarmist rumours\" about the country's possible return to stricter coronavirus regulations. The country has recorded a surge in Covid-19 infections over the last week, according to Health Minister Zweli Mkhize.\n\n\n\r\nGDP Growth Rate in South Africa averaged 2.11 percent from 1993 until 2020, and a record low of -51 percent in the second quarter of 2020.\n\n\n\n\nASIA\n\r\nAsia is well placed for economic recovery compared to the rest of the world because mostly it has successfully contained the coronavirus, said Andrew Tilton, chief Asia economist at Goldman Sachs. Globally, he said momentum in the industrial sector remains good and he is “reasonably upbeat on the recovery going into 2021.”\n\n\n\n\nAustralia\n\r\nConditions in Australia continue to improve. In recent weeks, the major winter sporting codes held their finals competitions with crowd attendance. The various states in Australia are progressively easing restrictions on border crossings and interstate travel is becoming a reality again. A limited travel “bubble” has opened with New Zealand and positive discussions are being held regarding Singapore, Japan and Taiwan.\n\n\n\r\nAustralia remains one of only nine countries around the world to hold a AAA credit rating from all three major credit rating agencies. Agriculture, mining, food, and fibre continue to provide export earnings for Australia while tourism is limited. The Australian Government’s “balance sheet was strong before the pandemic” and “Australia's economy is beginning to recover from its first recession in almost 30 years” and will according to the Australian Treasurer “rebound strongly once borders open”.\n\n\n\r\nThere is still a long way to go in recovering from this health and economic crisis but the Australian economy is fighting back. Around 60 per cent of the 1.3 million people who lost their job or were stood down on zero hours in April are now back at work. For the next calendar year, the economy is forecasted to grow by 4.25 per cent, and unemployment to fall to 6.5 per cent by the June Quarter 2022.\n\n\n\n\nIndia\n\r\nIndia's economy picked up speed in September as a revival in demand and business activity helped drive the South Asian nation toward recovery from the pandemic-induced slump.\n\n\n\r\nIndia improved its ranking in World Bank's Doing Business Report by 14 spots over last year and was ranked 63 among 190 countries in the 2020 edition of the report.\n\r\nIndia's Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) equity inflow reached US$469.99 billion between April 2000 to March 2020, with maximum contribution from services, computer software and hardware, telecommunications, construction, trading, and automobiles.\n\n\n\r\nIndia adds 2,320 MW solar capacity in COVID-19-hit January-September period - From January to September, when the Covid pandemic disrupted the economy, India added 2,320 MW of solar energy power, official data indicates.\n\n\n\r\nPassenger vehicle sales, one of the key indicators of demand, rose 26.5 per cent in September from a year ago. Retail sales too showed signs of stabilizing, even though it was nearly 70 per cent below the year-ago level, according to ShopperTrak.\n\n\n\r\nUS-based motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson partnered with the country's largest two-wheeler manufacturer, Hero MotoCorp, to sell and service its products in the nation. Hero MotoCorp will produce and market a range of luxury motorcycles under the Harley-Davidson brand name as part of a licencing agreement.\n\r\nTata Group to invest Rs5,000 crore to set up phone component plant for Apple in Tamil Nadu. Titan’s precision engineering division will provide expertise for project to be set up in Hosur industrial complex. The investment will be scaled up depending on the level of sourcing from the facility and could even touch Rs8,000 crore.\n\n\n\n\nSingapore\n\r\nSingapore’s unemployment rate rose to 3.6 per cent in September but at a slower rate compared to previous months, as the country reopened from a COVID-19-induced slowdown. The figures released on Friday (Oct 30) showed that the overall unemployment rate crept up by 0.2 percentage points from 3.4 per cent in August, which had already surpassed the record set during the global financial crisis in 2012. Officials warned that labour market conditions will stay soft amid the prolonged economic downturn.\n\n\n\r\nAfter more than 160 years in Singapore, Robinsons is closing its last two department stores at The Heeren and Raffles City Shopping Centre. This comes after several retail behemoths have announced store closures, both in and out of Singapore earlier this year. In April, Esprit announced it would close all 56 retail stores in Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau by the end of its financial year on Jun 30. In Singapore, the fashion retailer had 11 stores, including at ION Orchard, Paragon, Suntec City and Jewel Changi Airport. In October, H&M said it is planning to close hundreds of stores next year as COVID-19 crisis drove more shoppers online.\n\n\n\r\nOnline shopping has become increasingly popular among consumers amid changing purchasing behaviour and COVID-19 restrictions. Demand for large-scale department store concepts has also weakened significantly, with official data showing a 35.3 per cent drop in retail sales at department stores in August.\n\n\n\n\nNew Zealand\n\r\nThe New Zealand Activity Index (NZAC) showed a recovery in September, with activity up 1.0% on September 2019. Most constituent indicators were above 2019 levels such as traffic movements, grid demand, and the performance of manufacturing index. Other indicators, such as business confidence and job advertisements, were still below last year’s levels. The number of people receiving income support (including the COVID-19 Income Relief Payment) had declined from August but was still high compared to September 2019.\n\n\n\r\nThe NZIER Quarterly Survey of Business Opinion (QSBO) showed that business sentiment and activity indicators improved in the September quarter, reflecting a combination of fiscal support, pent-up demand, strong housing and construction activity and a pick-up in domestic tourism.\n\n\n\r\nNZIER report that the strong pipeline of Government construction work over the coming years is supporting a rebound in construction confidence, while services sector firms remain relatively cautious about the outlook, with a net 49% expecting worse outcomes ahead.\n\n\n\r\nSentiment on the general business outlook has improved but remains deeply pessimistic with a net 39.4% of firms expecting the outlook to deteriorate. Employment expectations were positive, with net 10% of firms expecting more hires this quarter, and firms are experiencing increased difficulty in finding skilled labour.\n\n\n\n\nEUROPE\n\r\nThe region’s predicted “2nd wave” of Covid19 is here as the winter starts. A number of key countries have announced either complete lockdown or regional lockdowns that will undoubtedly weaken the return to economic growth. The region is still several percentage points below pre Covid GDP.\n\n\n\n\nFrance\n\r\nThe lockdown decided by the President came into force last Friday, October 30th, 2020 at 0:00 am. A containment intended to be more flexible than that of the spring. The head of Government, who justified the measures announced by the need to \"face the violence of the second epidemic wave\" of Covid-19, was accompanied by some of his ministers including Bruno Le Maire (economy) who detailed the business support plan estimated at €15 billion per month (€20 billion has been provided for in the amended finance law for 2020).\n\n\n\r\nNew containment measures have forced the government to revise its GDP decline forecast for this year. The Minister of Economy indicated that the wealth produced in 2020 would fall by 11%. The problem is that the second wave of the epidemic and the new health measures will again have a negative impact on the end of the year. Bruno Le Maire said he thought that GDP would fall by 15% in November with the new containment. A slower pace than last spring when the GDP plunged by 30% during the two months of the first confinement but still impressive.\n\n\n\r\nFrench household consumption spending fell sharply in September after a small rise in August, due to a \"significant drop\" in purchases of manufactured goods and food. These expenses thus fell by 5.1% last month, after having risen by 2.2% in August. This decline in September was mainly due to a sharp drop (-6.8%) in purchases of manufactured goods, particularly textiles (-15.9% after +22.0% in August).\n\n\n\r\nThe effects of the health and economic crisis are having a strong impact on the framework of labour market. The drop in recruitment could particularly affect young graduates, older workers and job-seeking managers.\n\n\n\r\nIn the fourth quarter, companies could recruit between 37,000 and 47,000 managers, a volume that is however subject to caution given the uncertainties on the health front. Overall, over the year, the number of executive recruitments would be 30 to 40% lower than the record reached in 2019. The executive job market was experiencing steady growth and 281,300 executives were hired last year. The health and economic crisis have since changed this situation.\n\n\n\r\nGenerally, more affected by episodes of crisis, young graduates find themselves in a more difficult position when senior managers in posts worry about their ability to bounce back if they lose their jobs. Jobseekers, on the other hand, face a major reduction in the number of jobs available on the managerial labour market.\n\n\n\n\nUK\n\r\nThe UK Government has fragmented rules to the Covid19 2nd wave. Governments in Wales and Northern Ireland have instigated a “circuit breaker” complete lockdown. Scotland has introduced a regional lockdown and England is going into a month long lockdown as of 5th November. Recently there has been a levelling off of cases albeit from a high level.\n\n\n\r\nGovernment has instigated a range of support packages to try to stop mass redundancies. Currently unemployment stands at 4.5% but is predicted to climb to 8%+ by year-end.\n\n\n\r\nGDP growth fell by 20.4% in Q2 2020, it has recovered more than 50% of this loss. However growth is slowing and will be hampered by winter lockdowns. The service sector has seen the best recovery to date and manufacturing figures although fragile are in the positive.\n\n\n\n\nAMERICAS\n\r\nThe Americas and particularly regions in USA are continuing to see uncertainty of the pandemic and elections create economic stagnation. Although the USA continues to show economic recovery, it is showing signs of slowing down and is not back to pre Covid levels.\n\n\n\n\nSouth America\n\r\nThe continent is dealing with the pandemic from a weak economic base. Countries are adopting a variety of measures, but many are unable to effectively support businesses and this will no doubt lead to an increase in unemployment.\n\n\n\n\nCanada\n\r\nCanada has seen a partial lockdown in cities such as Toronto that has resulted in the number of cases reducing. The Canadian Government has a determined and focused program to significantly reduce the virus transmission.\n\n\n\n\nUSA\n\r\nThese last few weeks have been a mix of more opportunities and exceptional levels of competition on price and “showing leg”.\n\n\n\r\nWe have had several new client initiatives, but none have yet signed a new agreement. Concern over hiring at the executive level during this period while layoffs are continuing is causing concern despite a perceived need to go forward on critical roles. In one recent case, our competition presented at least 10 prospective candidates with their proposal to prove they had a ready store of candidates. The client was not sophisticated enough to understand why that might be a problem. Others are just stalled as the fear is that income and earnings will be hurt further by recent market fluctuation.\n\n\n\r\nThe national election is on November 3rd but if it is close there might be a legally contested outcome delaying the final result. President Trump has been very vocal about that. Normally a level of uncertainty in the world can help us to close deals. In this case, that is not happening and as our national leader chooses to exacerbate the impact of the virus and has issued rules impacting our health care and made a very controversial appointment to our Supreme Court causing even more uncertainty and disruption. We expect the softness and uncertainty to continue.\n\n\n\r\nWe hope that you, your family, and work colleagues continue to stay healthy and safe. We at The Taplow Group are here to support you and your business through this crisis. We will be back with another update soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3061)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "Taplow Group – 9th 2020 Global Business Overview\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nMonday, October 5, 2020\n/\nCategories: \nNews\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaplow Group – Pandemic Business Overview\n\n\nThe Taplow firms have been active throughout the pandemic. This is the Ninth update in our Business Updates series from our partners around the world.\n\n\nKey Findings\n\n\nWorking from Home\n: Many countries have again encouraged office workers to work from home. This is having an adverse effect on the hospitality sector and ancillary sectors.\n\n\nEmployee welfare\n: With the ramping up of testing, many are experiencing the need to self-isolate, bringing additional economic stress to employees and employers, alike. Companies must have a clear strategy regarding the employees who are self-isolating and their businesses.\n\n\nGeopolitical affects\n: There is an urgent need for Governments around the world to act quickly to address spikes and upturns in the pandemic. Business decisions taken one day are neutralised the next day by government strategies, forcing business leaders to act with nimbleness and clarity.\n\n\nASIA\n\n\nAustralia\n\n\nAustralia continues to recover from its COVID-19 economic setbacks. One region in Australia, Victoria, experienced a major second wave of COVID-19 that resulted in a severe shutdown of that region and making the other Australian regions excluding any travel from this region. All other regions in Australia are progressively emerging from the “Big Government” management of the community, the health, economic and financial regulation, and influence.\n\n\n\r\nTourism and hospitality sectors have been severely impacted. Government financial support for “Job Keeper” and “Job Seeker” is being revised and wound back and additional investment is being made in sectors of high potential employment and economic growth.\n\n\n\r\nForecasts for agricultural production are strong and produce prices are holding firm. Mining and Resources are continuing to perform strongly. Infrastructure and construction sectors are investing, and many projects are underway and numerous others are being forecasted.\n\n\n\r\nThere has been a review of the Foreign Investment regulation in Australia. The A$ has strengthened against the US$ and is holding relatively firmly. The equities market have continued to improve.\n\r\nThere has been a large reduction in consumer debt on credit cards over the past two quarters. Volumes of parcels through the Australia Post business have been at a record levels for many months as Australians have embraced online consumer behaviour.\n\n\nIndia\n\n\nAccording to IDC's Worldwide Artificial Intelligence Spending Guide forecast, India's Artificial Intelligence (AI) spending is set to grow at 30.8% Compound Annual Growth Rate to USD 880.5 million in 2023. This is largely due to the fast adoption of AI and cloud technologies for intelligent solutions to transform businesses and gain competitive advantage.\n\n\n\r\nNITI Aayog and Embassy of the Netherlands signed a Statement of Intent for decarbonisation and energy transition agenda, which aims at creating a platform that enables key stakeholder’s collaboration to develop innovative solutions for sustainable development.\n\n\n\r\nIndia’s GDP growth is expected to grow in the range of 6.0 to 6.5 per cent in 2020-21. GDP growth moderated to 4.8 per cent in H1 of 2019-20, amidst a weak environment for global manufacturing, trade and demand.\n\n\n\r\nBusiness to Business (B2B) tech start-ups are driving tech adoption in India. There are over 4,200 B2B tech new businesses in India.According to a study by NetApp and Zinnov, 63 percent out of these are taking a shot at big business innovation in the banking, financial services, insurance, medical care, retail and car verticals.\n\n\n\r\nRadware, a leading provider of solutions for cyber security and application delivery, and Bharti Airtel ('Airtel'), the largest integrated telco in India, today announced a collaboration under which Airtel will provide enterprise customers with Radware's Cloud DDoS Protection, Cloud WAF, and Bot Manager cloud security services.\n\n\n\r\nA new report said on Friday that online food is going to be the next battlefield for growth, growing to over $18 billion by 2024, as businesses from Reliance to Amazon put their top dollar at your doorstep in serving regular groceries.\n\n\n\r\nHildegard Wortmann, who is responsible for global sales and marketing for Audi AG has stated that the pandemic has peaked out in many countries and they are coming back to normal in terms of business. A recovery is recognisable from worldwide incoming orders, which are now only slightly below the pre-corona level. She expects the festive season in India to drive sales momentum before industry revives in 2021. Launching a new mid-term plan - \"Consistently Audi\" she says the focus on India will be quality over quantity and driving sustainable business.\n\n\n\r\nConde Nast has launched its technology lab in Bengaluru. The company plans to recruit ~60 people in 2020 and >300 people by the end of 2021, to design and build the next-gen digital content platforms across its media brands portfolio (including Vogue, GQ and Architectural Digest).\n\n\n\r\nGeneral Atlantic announced it will invest Rs 3,675 crore (US$ 498.58 million) in Reliance Retail Ventures Limited (RRVL), a subsidiary of Reliance Industries, to drive transformative growth in the retail sector and accelerate India’s position in the global digital economy.\n\n\nSingapore\n\n\nSingapore will continue to provide a business-friendly environment for international companies and workers to operate in, while ensuring a fair and level playing field for Singaporeans, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said in a Facebook post on Oct 2. Mr Chan noted that the issue of foreign manpower and the role they play in Singapore's economy have \"attracted much attention\" over the last few months, and that \"it has not escaped the notice of our international business community.\" Responding to these concerns, Mr Chan assured that Singapore remains committed to being open and connected to the world. He also recognised the role that international companies and workers have played in growing Singapore's economy and intend to continue to ensure Singapore provide a business-friendly environment for them to operate in.\n\n\n\r\nSingapore’s factory activity expanded for the third consecutive month, after five months of contraction amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for September recorded a “faster expansion” at 50.3, up 0.2 point from the previous month. Despite continuous weak employment readings, manufacturers are becoming more optimistic and in anticipation of the next reopening phase for all businesses.\n\n\n\r\nA series of industry-specific human resources (HR) playbooks is being developed to guide HR professionals to address and solve challenges specific to their sectors. The Manpower Ministry and the Institute for Human Resource Professionals are working together with sector agencies and HR experts to curate best practices, tools and practical use cases for these playbooks. The goal of strengthening the HR capabilities of organisations to support business and workforce transformation. The playbooks will first be introduced for the finance and food services, before being expanded into other sectors.\n\n\nNew Zealand\n\n\nThere have been few community cases of COVID-19 during the second week of New Zealand (excluding Auckland) at Alert Level 1 (freedom to do anything but the need to be aware). A large number of cases were reported on 1 October, though all of these were in managed isolation at the border.\n\n\n\r\nThe bounce-back out of the first lockdown was vigorous, but much of it reflected one-off sources of spending: pent-up demand from when the shops were shut, and holiday budgets being spent on spas and e-bikes. Business confidence, consumer confidence and even weekly spending were all running out of puff before COVID reappeared. Remarkably, business sentiment measures have improved after the return of COVID, but they do remain at recessionary levels.\n\n\n\r\nANZ Bank estimates that the loss of international tourism and the foreign student industry wipes out about 5% of the economy, with the flow-on to retail and hospitality making it worse, and the fact New Zealander’s can’t flee for warmer climes in winter providing an offset. And unfortunately, the sectors most impacted by this shock are the people-centric ones: tourism, hospitality, and retail. The hit to employment is going to be correspondingly larger than it would be if the shock to GDP were to agriculture, for example. That means that while there is a lot of uncertainty, it looks likely that the unemployment rate will rise meaningfully higher than it did in the 2008/09 recession.\n\n\n\r\nThe worst affected industries include accommodation and food services (down 4,913 jobs) and transport, postal and warehousing (down 6,092 jobs). These service industries were most affected by border closures and higher restrictions imposed on hospitality at higher alert levels but have partly recovered in recent months.\n\n\nEUROPE\n\n\nFrance\n\n\nIn its growth forecasts for the next five years, the French government expects to return in 2024 to the level of activity that France would have had without the Covid-19 pandemic. After this year's recession and the strong rebound of 8% of the GDP expected next year, the French government is expecting a return to the same level of activity in 2024. The following year, growth would still be sustained: it is expected to reach 3.5% in 2022. The Ministry of the Economy hopes that during 2022, GDP will return to its pre-pandemic level. Then, logically, growth would gradually return to its cruising speed. It would be 2% in 2023 and 1.4% in 2024.\n\n\n\r\nHowever, France, like its European neighbours, will face a difficulty; inflation will remain very low and even disappear in the short term. The consumer price index, excluding tobacco, is expected to rise by only 0.2% this year and then to rise very slowly, to 0.6% in 2021, 1% in 2022 and 1.4% in 2023. In September, the consumer price index rose only 0.1% year-on-year. Low oil prices and the appreciation of the euro contribute to this low inflation but are not the only drivers. The main explanation is that the crisis has, at least in the short term, a deflationary effect. The loss of activity leads to an increase in unemployment, which weighs on wages, consumption and therefore prices.\n\n\n\r\nThe repercussions of the health and economic crisis are expected to be massive on the job market in France. The unemployment rate is expected to be \"around 9.5%\" of the active population by the end of 2020, 2.4 points higher than mid-2020 and 1.4 points higher than a year earlier, warns the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE). The salaried employment \"would be almost stable in the second half of the year\", according to INSEE, after a drop of 715,000 jobs in the first half of the year, adds the institute in its economic forecast.\n\n\n\r\nIn August 2020, the private sector lost 10,600 jobs, according to the results of the National Report on Employment in France by ADP. \"COVID-19 continues to impact employment in France,\" said Ahu Yildirmaz, Vice President of the ADP Research Institute. \"The August report shows that business services, trade and financial services are the most heavily affected, even though all sectors have recorded job losses,\" she said.\n\n\nFinland\n\n\nA news quote from a few weeks ago says that “the Finnish economy emerged from corona spring as EU winner, most economists say the worst is over”.\n\r\nSeasonally adjusted GDP fell by just 3.2 percent in the second quarter compared to the previous quarter. On average, EU countries’ GDP plunged by 11.7 percent between the first and second quarters of this year.\n\r\nHowever, going to the second wave, the technology industry foresees the biggest impact. There is low demand in export resulting in empty order books.\n\n\nGermany\n\n\nNew assignments have been coming in since the end of June from different areas – Construction, IT, Medical, Public sector. The positive trend has been confirmed by additional client requests and meetings related to\n\r\nA Chinese company interested to start business in Europe\n\r\nThe owner of a German tech-company looking for a successor and guidance during the succession management process\n\r\nNorway\n\r\nBusiness in Norway is looking good at the end of Q3. For Taplow this results in new assignments from existing clients, as well as business with two new clients.\n\r\nTaplow Norway has signed a contract with a new consultant in the Life Science sector.\n\n\nUK\n\n\nRegional lockdowns continue to roll out across the country to counteract the spike in the virus in the past few weeks.\n\r\nThe furlough scheme ends in October and the Government has introduced a replacement scheme that will be active until April 2021, but a rise in unemployment is expected.\n\r\nThe Government suspended its annual budget review for Q3 2020, to focus on developing actions as the pandemic fluctuates.\n\n\nAMERICAS\n\n\nBrazil\n\n\nAlthough Brazil is entering a documented stability period, on a slighthly pointing down curve in both, new infections and death cases, the country is still seeing high pandemic figures – a daily average of 693 deaths/140,700 in total and 28,000 of new daily cases of infection/4.7 million in total. 14 states in the Northern-Northeastern, Southern and Westcentral áreas of Brazil are considered actual áreas of stability with slight reduction of deaths and new infections. 9 states in the Southern, Southeastern, and Westcentral areas are in the reduction mode. 3 other states, including Rio, are in the growing cases mode. Most of the commercial, services and industrial activities were reopenned in the country under strict safety precautions, such as the reduction of working/service hours, reduction of people involved, social distancing, the obligatory use of masks, hygiene measures, etc.\n\r\n65 million of officially unemployed, informal workers are being granted an “Emergency Aid” for 6 months, July-December 2020, amounting to nearly US$800 each. This social measure has brought substantial relief for those unprotected extracts and is helping the general economy, via consumption of goods and services.\n\r\nInitial forecasts pointing to a -9.5% of GDP rate for 2020 has been reviewed and updated to a lower figure between -5%/-6%. Economic reforms such as the Fiscal and Administrative (govern spendig areas) are currently under negotiations between the Government and Congress.\n\n\nUSA and Canada\n\n\nUS business is more impacted by the political situation than by the economic and virus issues. Companies are reluctant to make major hiring decisions. Looking internally is more prevalent and even with the pressures to recruit more diverse populations, many of the larger firms are still reticent to not hire “friends and family”.\n\r\nAs we are introducing “Assured Diversity” to more of our clients and prospects, we are beginning to see a flicker of interest in using this time to become acquainted with more diverse prospective candidates for senior roles.\n\n\n\r\nWe hope that you, your family, and work colleagues continue to stay healthy and safe. We at The Taplow Group are here to support you and your company through this crisis and beyond. We will be back with another set of updates soon. Till then, take care and stay safe!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3296)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

CXO positions or C-suite leaders help set the vision and strategy for a company, drive the business, and take the organization on the path to a sustainable growth. These individuals are extremely competent, skilled and come with a plethora of experience and excellent leadership abilities.\nWhen one is hiring for such important positions, there can be no room for mistake. The cost of a bad hire can be huge and cost dearly to the business. Hence, you cannot rely on the typical recruitment agencies. You need\nexecutive search services.\n The \n executive search consultants\n possess industry knowledge, years of experience, and a thorough understanding of your business process. These consultants would hire the best candidates who readily align with the culture, strategy, and processes of an organization.\n \nImportance of Cultural Fit\n \nSo, what do you think would make for an excellent hire? Years of professional experience, the right technical skills, or academic qualifications can be the starting point, but the most important checkbox is the new hire's cultural fit.\nOrganizational culture is like glue; it holds the organization, its employees, and processes together. Cultural fit is a major aspect when hiring for CXO positions. Cultural fit is a way to understand how much a new individual would adjust and adapt to its values, norms, beliefs, and practices.\n \nA bad hire can have a significant negative impact on the business and the productivity of the employees.\n \nCultural fit is extremely crucial for employee retention. Employee turnover at the CXO level is more like a financial drain, and no business would like to incur such losses.\n \nCXO positions are the most crucial positions in a company. You would want someone who leads by setting an example, creating a positive work environment, and has a tremendous influence on the employees.\n \nHence cultural fit is imperative while recruiting for the CXO positions.\n \nAdvantages of Executive Search\n \nExecutive recruitment consultants\n have an extensive network, deep industry know-how, and impeccable judgment. They would hire the best candidate for your organization. Not every \n global executive search consultants firm\n can help you identify the right talent who has the perfect skill set and is aligned to the organizational culture. You need to do deep research in order to come up with someone relevant.\nExecutive search services are both, cost and time effective solutions. Experienced executive search consultants focus on hiring the best talents in the minimum time.\nGlobal executive search consultants firms have an extensive database of talented individuals.\nThey maintain complete transparency, and you have complete control over the process.\nMany-a-times, executive search services guide a newly formed position and help in onboarding too.\n \nFinal Thoughts\n \nSuppose you do not involve executive recruitment consultants for your CXO positions; in that case, you either face the risk of hiring the wrong candidate or having a prolonged and expensive recruitment process. Hiring via executive search firms ensures that the right candidate is matched with the right position. \n Executive recruitment consultants\n include cultural fit assessment in the recruitment process, to enable you to hire candidates who would help drive your business to newer heights and long-term success.

Human capital is one of the most crucial resources of all organizations and determines the operating efficiency. But most organizations fail to invest properly in human capital. Organizations can hire \n Human Capital Consultancy Services\n to advise them to manage their employees for optimum output. Here are the major benefits of investing in Human Capital as emphasized by most of the major \nHuman Resources Management Firms.\n \nIncreased Employee Satisfaction\n \nInvesting in \n human capital development \nleads to greater employee satisfaction and thus directly impacts the commitment of employees towards their responsibilities. Investing in employee education also shows the employee that the organization values his/her contribution and wants to invest in them further for their professional growth. An increased employee satisfaction is reflected through an improved workplace culture. Happy employees form a coherent and improving work system where they work on achieving organizational goals effectively.\nImproved Retention\n \nMost professionals in \n Leadership Development Management\n field have said that their employees give more importance to career development opportunities when compared with an increased salary. If the employees are receiving support for professional education, they are much less likely to switch to other organizations. Most employees desire to work for organizations that invest in their professional development and would not want to look for job alternatives if they feel this need is met in their current job.\nBetter Recruitment\n \nHuman capital management\n is one of the most important areas for fostering talent in the organization. An organization that invests in human capital is more attractive to potential candidates. Do you know that Millennials especially look for organizations, which not only provide them good opportunities and projects but also platforms for professional development for a better career ahead? And older employees also look for organizations that are willing to invest in human capital because it ensures them that they can pursue a stable career with ample opportunities without looking for other jobs.\n \nBetter communication\n \nMost \nHuman Resources Consulting\n Firms that provide \nHuman Capital Consultancy Services\n also emphasize on the impact of investment in human capital on the internal communication in an organization. This is mainly through the professional development courses introduced within the organization that teach and encourage the employees to be more open about their views. This improved communication not only supports efficiency but also aids creativity within the organization.\nIncreased ROI\n \nOver the years, many Leadership Development Management efforts have supported the use of \n Human Capital Consultancy Services.\n It has been proven time and again that investment in human capital significantly improves Return on Investment for the organizations. A good investment motivates the employees through monetary and non-monetary incentives and this boosts the employee commitment towards the organization. This boosted commitment directly impacts the efficiency which thereby increases the output from various business processes. In financial terms, the operational efficiency is boosted yielding more revenue without significant increase in the operational expenses. This increases the profits and hence the ROI as well.\nAt The Taplow Group we have extensive experience in designing, delivering and benchmarking Human Capital projects in addition to Human Capital Search, to ensure our clients fully realize their employees’ full potential.

    "content": "Make The Most of Your Remote Meetings\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nThursday, September 10, 2020\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAs you read this article, millions of people worldwide are adjusting their screens, microphone’s volume and preparing for the next remote meeting. Remote meetings are probably the biggest legacy that COVID-19 would leave for us. The global pandemic has pushed everyone to adopt the new remote working culture. Today, clients and employees, physically separated by thousands and thousands of miles, connect and conduct business, courtesy – the Internet and the tools that enable remote meetings.\nWith remote meetings, you do not feel the 'buzz' of the employees or team members around you. How would managers and leaders make remote meetings as effective as face-to-face meetings? What steps can be taken to motivate employees so that they take responsibilities and actively deliver work without compromising on performance?\nLearn from these five proven techniques on how to keep employees involved and productive over remote meetings.\n#1 Set Clear Meeting Expectations\nMany people are still adjusting to the concept of remote meetings. Hence, all members must be on the same page concerning the team expectations, meeting norms, and online business procedures. As a manager, one must involve team members to prepare a meeting charter or take their ideas to set down clear rules and expectations for everyone.\n#2 Meeting security\nSecurity is a big concern in the digital world, especially when most business is happening online. Robust security controls clearly defined host rights and monitored end-user behavior can go a long way to secure online meetings. You can randomize the meeting IDs, make sure everyone registers before attending a meeting, and keep different host passwords to ensure the safe remote meetings.\n#3 Always have an agenda ready\nEvery remote meeting should be having an agenda, set and shared before the meeting. This gives a clear idea of the reason for the meeting, the important areas to be discussed, and the attendees' expectations. It also shares the details about the host or facilitator and a few specific instructions to be followed during the meeting. This ensures collaborative participation, better teamwork, and value addition for all attendees.\n#4 Ensure that there is some room for water-cooler talks\nWater-cooler conversations are casual talks between employees, mostly on non-work-related topics. But with remote meetings, there is hardly any scope for these casual talks. During remote meetings, sometime can be kept aside at the beginning or towards the end for such light-hearted talks, maybe something exciting in someone's life, weekend plans, or a new hobby. These water-cooler conversations promote harmony and team collaboration. It brings employees closer and increases their satisfaction at work.\n#5 Turn on your video please\nOne of the best ways to show connect and express emotions is by turning on the video during the meeting during online meets. Instead of using the raise hand emoticon, why don't you physically raise your hands? This not only builds a positive environment but also gives that human touch to the otherwise virtual world of business.\nFinal Thoughts\nRemote meetings would continue to be an integral part of business operations. If you can combine technology with clear expectations and some effective measures, you can always have happy, engaged, and productive team members.\nAt The Taplow Group we continue to stay connected both with our teams and with our clients worldwide through remote meetings.

It takes years of experience for a person to become a good leader and these leaders are instrumental in driving changes and innovation in an organization. As the importance of leaders is being understood in the industry, many leadership development management services firms have come up. The real-time application and guidance help participants to work on their existing skillset leading to future growth.\nWhen do you need leadership coaching?\nSometimes organizations fail to realize when they need help. Different industries try to search for people who have a solid organizational commitment like \nglobal consumer sector executive search\n but often cannot find good leaders. It is very important for organizations to identify signs like ineffective team management, workers being overwhelmed by the nature of job etc. These are indications that your organization needs to partner with leadership development firms to help the employees maximise their potential.\nHow does leadership coaching help?\nEvery leader has his/her journey which is unique but there are certain aspects which are common among all good leaders. These traits can be developed through \nleadership development\n programs. Leadership coaching can help an organization in the following manner.\n1. This training can help to shape people in a way that they fit well into the organizational culture. A good leader must always understand the mission and vision of an organization and influence people to move towards them.\n2. Many companies employ an industrial executive search to find out people who can assume leadership positions. It has been found that most of the times people who have a background of leadership training programs fit well for such roles.\n3. Leadership coaching programs improve performance, attitude, skills as well as the well-being of employees. It is a holistic development which helps individuals realize their strengths and weaknesses and teaches how them how to address these issues. The purpose is to instil positive behaviour in people even under adverse circumstances.\nLeadership development management services firms \nare popular because they provide mentors who have years of knowledge and expertise in particular fields. They guide the mentees on how to align with the business and strategic goals in an organization. Such kind of first-hand learning experience is very beneficial for better job performance later.\n4. This kind of coaching helps to develop self-confidence and improve communication skills. Most of these programs design activities for the employees and also provide tools to perform them. Different kinds of real-life leadership scenarios are created which help people to come out of their comfort zones.\nLeadership development\n aims to provoke thoughts which would inspire people to do productive activities for the organization. People understand themselves and the responsibilities towards their roles which in turn helps them to take good decisions which can be beneficial for the organization. Several researches conducted in the past few years have shown that leadership development coaching has been very effective in helping employees reach their goals and overall progress as an organization. At The Taplow Group we have extensive experience in designing, delivering and benchmarking leadership development coaching projects in addition to Human Capital Search, to ensure our clients fully realize their employees’ full potential.

This is the Eighth in our Business Updates series from our partners around the world. The situation is showing clear signs of recovery although nuances exist in every country and region.\n\n\nKey Findings\n\n\nWorking from Home\n: Surveys show that employees are enjoying working from home. But is your business monitoring productivity, employee wellbeing and effects on teams within business?\n\n\nEmployee welfare\n: How does WFM impact employees? Many of whom maybe feeling isolated, working, and living within small spaces with little face to face interaction with colleagues.\n\n\nDigital Transformation:\n Many firms/offices have an enhanced and cohesive digital strategy; but how does that get impacted when the workforce is WFH? Does your business have new strategies to enable employees to be effective in their new workspaces?\n\n\nAFRICA\n\n\nSouth Africa\n\n\nThe WHO's Africa regional director Matshidiso Moeti said it was spreading beyond capital cities and that a lack of tests and other supplies was hampering responses.\n\r\nSouth Africa is seeing business reopening, with many planning how to develop their services post pandemic.\n\n\nASIA\n\n\nAustralia\n\n\nBusiness and economic conditions continue to slowly improve in Australia. The major sporting clubs of football, racing, netball and rugby are all in full competition with spectator attendance, although with revised guidelines for social distancing and behaviour.\n\r\nThe Australian Federal Parliament convened this week in the Australian Capital Canberra with Politian’s attending for both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Six of the eight Australian states and territories are progressively moving towards the new normal of business and one state, Victoria, continues in a hard lockdown for another 3 weeks because of a major second surge of COVID-19.\n\r\nThe Australian Stock Exchange is experiencing an increasing recovery and the major ASX listed companied are now in the reporting season for their results. The Australian dollar has been increasing in value against the American dollar, particularly over the past two weeks.\n\r\nThe Australian Federal government has extended financial support for companies, employees that have been stood down and unemployed.\n\r\nThe Australian Federal Government has made an agreement for the production of COVID-19 vaccine in Australia and there have been very positive announcements of vaccines under development in Australia for COVID-19 and the likely availability in 2021.\n\r\nThe national border remains closed to international travel and majority of internal state borders are also closed.\n\n\nIndia\n\n\nMinister for Road Transport, Highways and MSMEs, Mr Nitin Gadkari to lay foundation Stone and inaugurate 35 highway projects worth over Rs 9400 crore in Madhya Pradesh(State in Central India) on August 25, 2020.\n\r\nItaly's Snam eyes investments in Indian gas pipelines: Italy’s Snam, the operator of Europe’s largest natural gas transmission network, is planning to invest in the Indian gas pipeline business and has roped in GAIL’s former chairman B C Tripathi as its advisor.\n\r\nAmazon India launches online pharmacy service: Amazon’s pharmacy plans include rapid expansion into the trillion-dollar healthcare care and insurance sector, creating a buffet of healthcare-related acquisitions, rolling out expedited drug shipping, and drug discounting–and perhaps shaping the pharmacy of the future.\n\r\nReliance Industries retail unit has acquired a majority equity stake in online pharma company Netmeds for around Rs 620 crore, directly taking on Amazon which has forayed into the e-pharmacy business.\n\r\nHyderabad to host Medtronic's largest global R&D centre outside US: Global leader in medical technology, Medtronic plans to invest Rs 1,200 crore (US$ 170.24 million) in scaling up and expanding its current research and development centre into a modern engineering and innovation hub in Hyderabad.\n\r\nUltratech to invest Rs1500 crore in capex in FY21: Ultratech Cement Ltd, India’s largest cement company, plans to invest Rs 1,500 crore (US$ 212.80 million) in capital expenditure this fiscal despite the constraints of an ongoing pandemic, said Mr Kumar Mangalam Birla, Chairman, at the annual shareholder meeting.\n\r\nLogistics firm Delhivery plans to invest up to Rs 300 crore over two years for expansion: Delhivery, a logistics firm, plans to invest up to Rs 300 crore (US$ 42.56 million) in 18-24 months on expansion, including increasing fleet size and setting up of trucking hubs.\n\r\nNifty, Sensex end near six-month highs on coronavirus treatment hopes: Indian shares closed just shy of their six-month highs on Monday, powered by a rally in private-sector banks as more businesses resumed operations after lockdowns and hopes of a treatment for COVID-19 brightened.\n\r\nIndia crosses a milestone, conducts more than 2 crore COVID tests\n\n\nSingapore\n\n\nSingapore's Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Thursday (Aug 27) announced a slew of changes to its foreign workforce policy, including raising the minimum qualifying salary for Employment Passes and S Passes for the second time this year and introducing a higher salary requirement for Employment Pass holders in the financial services sector. These new salary criteria will be effective from May 1, 2021. The ministry said that the changes were made to continue to encourage fair hiring, particularly in the current economic climate.\n\r\nNoting that 90 employers had their work pass privileges suspended this year because of Fair Consideration Framework infringements, MOM said: \"Employers are expected to take fair hiring seriously and give due consideration to local job applicants regardless of their age, gender and ethnicity.\n\r\n\"Discrimination against local job applications in favour of foreign applicants is especially unacceptable. Employers who practise discriminatory hiring in any form will have their work pass privileges cut back and may also face prosecution.\"\n\n\nNew Zealand\n\n\nNew Zealand’s largest city, Auckland will join the rest of New Zealand at Alert Level 2 on 31 August following a period of time where Auckland was at Level 3 given the community outbreaks that recently occurred following 100+ days of zero cases reported. The rest of the country has been at Level 2 for the same period and will remain so for at least another week. This has had a major impact on domestic travel with one of the larger airlines (Jetstar) suspending all flights until a return to Level 1 and New Zealand’s main domestic carrier Air New Zealand substantially reducing their flight schedule due to the unavailability of almost all travel to and from Auckland.\n\r\nNZIER analysts predict that businesses are typically more cautious heading into a general election (October 17), as uncertainty over the outcome leads businesses to hold off on planning. This time around, the outbreak of COVID-19 has added much more uncertainty for businesses, with hiring and investment intentions falling sharply. They are expect that businesses and households will remain cautious about spending and investment over the coming year.\n\r\nThe Wage subsidy is due to end 1st September 2020 and the New Zealand Government has signalled that there will be no more assistance at this stage. The New Zealand Government reported that the $11 billion wage subsidy helped nine in 10 New Zealand businesses which received it, survive the COVID-19 lockdown.\n\r\nRetail sales experienced their biggest quarterly drop on record, while median incomes fell for the first time. Most retail industries experienced a decline in sales volumes, with the biggest falls recorded in food and beverage services (down 38%), motor vehicles and parts (down 15%) and fuel (down 24%). The only industry not to experience a fall in volumes was non-store and commission-based retailing (online sales).\n\n\nEUROPE\n\n\nThe EU has agreed a 1€ Trillion recovery fund for its 26 member states. A mixture of loans and grants will be offered to European Countries. Many EU countries are seeing an upturn in positive test results and Governments are grappling with stemming these numbers to avoid second national lockdowns that would have major economic ramifications.\n\n\nFrance\n\n\nAfter exploding in March and April, the number of jobseekers with no activity fell sharply in July in France for the third consecutive month, according to statistics published by the Research Department of the Ministry of Labor (Dares). Specifically, the decline reached 174,300, compared to -204,700 in June and -149,900 in May, bringing the total in this category to just over 4 million people, a level 560,000 higher than at the end of February. As in May and June, this decrease was mainly due to the shift of these jobseekers into reduced activity. The figures therefore remain at historically high levels, but the trends - to be confirmed - show that the recovery in activity is supporting the recovery in employment, even if it is precarious. Thus, the combined workforce of all jobseekers’ categories fell by nearly 45,000 in July to 6.11 million. This is the first decline since March. As employees have returned to work on a massive scale, the number of employees in partial activity in July is being estimated at 2.4 million after 4.5 million in June? Wii this upturn be sustainable? The answer lies on the effect of the recovery plan and its component for youth employment in particular.\n\n\n\r\nFrance's GDP fell by 13.8% in the 2nd quarter of 2020. After a 5.9% drop in GDP in the first quarter, France officially entered recession at the end of the first half of the year. While the gradual lifting of restrictions led to \"a gradual recovery of economic activity in May and then June, after the low point reached in April\", the quarter bears the stigma of the obligation imposed on the French to stay at home: consumer spending fell by 11.5%, \"which strongly increases the savings rate\" (27.4% against 14.9% on average in 2019). The pandemic that has affected most countries in the world has also affected foreign demand, with exports falling by 25%. As imports did not fall in the same proportion (-16.4%), \"foreign trade made a negative contribution to GDP growth\" of 2.5 points over the quarter. National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) forecasts a 19% rebound in GDP in the 3rd quarter, but for 2020, the Government is forecasting a historical decline of 11%. GDP is not expected to return to its pre-crisis level until 2022, when growth of 1.4% is expected.\n\n\nGermany\n\n\nNew assignments have been coming in since the end of June from different areas, namely, Construction, IT, Medical and Public sector. The positive trend has been confirmed by additional client requests and meetings related to a.) a Chinese company that’s interested to start business in Europe and b.) The owner of a German tech-company looking for a successor and guidance during the succession management process.\n\r\nThis change in our business started at least three months earlier and more positive than expected. At this stage we hope for a steady improvement during last quarter of the year and first quarter of 2021, that’s globally supported by positive economic and political news.\n\n\nRussia\n\n\nRussia has now nearly one million confirmed corona cases. Nevertheless, the daily infection rates in Russia are decreasing. Due to this some of the staff is going back to office work and we can see an increase in business activities throughout industries.\n\r\nSurveys suggest that many people like to work from home but at the same time some companies are facing decreasing effectiveness because of this. Therefore, companies are keen to have employees back in office. Big companies are trying to schedule in such a way that just 25% of white collars are in office in order to maintain social distancing. Then they change every week. Those companies that have confirmed corona cases must go back to home office working mode.\n\r\nA main challenge for international companies with foreign managers and specialists is the travel restrictions. Only expatriates with working visas and included on a Governmental list are approved for entry. However, it is estimated that by October Russia should have a daily infection rate low enough to be considered a non-risk country for the EU, making it possible to travel freely again.\n\r\nMany companies are reducing staff or at least continuing a hiring freeze. Even the Russian oil industry is holding back hiring and some facilities are closed in Siberia.\n\n\nNorway\n\n\nNorway had its covid-19 peak in March but has managed to keep the outbreak under reasonable control.\n\r\n256 people have died (population 5.4 million)\n\r\n12.5% tested (673,000). 10,504 tested positive\n\r\nFocus on 1-meter distance, but not mandatory to use facemasks.\n\r\nEmployees encouraged to work from home\n\r\nAt a cost: Estimated GPA for 2020 will be down 6,5% from 2019\n\r\nTaplow Norway had a very week Q2. Turnover down 35% from 2019, with a negative EBIT\n\r\nFall 2020 seems to be more positive. Businesses are more eager to look forward. We have more assignment-offers out so far in August, than in April, May and June combined.\n\r\nTaplow Norway is in dialogue with a potential new consultant in the Life Science sector.\n\n\nUK\n\n\nAir corridors are constantly being reviewed and this is currently impacting vacations and will impact businesses in Q3 and Q4 of 2020.\n\r\nRetail sector has seen the turnover return in Q2 2020 to pre lockdown levels.\n\r\nSeparately, a closely watched survey showed that activity in the UK's services and manufacturing sectors has returned to growth last month.\n\r\nThe UK experienced a 20%+ contraction in the economy in Q2 2020, but signs are indicating that this is now being reversed in Q3 2020 and Q4 of 2020.\n\n\nAMERICAS\n\n\nThe Americas have seen a surge of Covid cases. The worry is that this is occurring in the summer months and will exacerbate healthcare’s ability to deal with cases as the flu season approaches. Canada is the only country seeing a reduction in cases and lockdown rules being eased.\n\n\nBrazil\n\n\nAccording to CEPAL, the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, pre-pandemic 2020 Latin America economy forecast had shown a modest 1.3% growth for the region, versus current -9.1% estimate. 18 million jobs will have disappeared in the area because of the pandemic. Prior to Covid-19, Argentina’s economy had been severely affected and saw significant decrease in its exports to China and to other countries.\n\r\nAlthough Covid-19 still remains active in higher levels than predicted, the Northern and Northeastern areas of the country seem to be well under control now. States of São Paulo and Rio seem to have reached a still high plateau, but the disease seems to be under control. The worst areas now are the south and central states and the interior of the state of São Paulo. The recovery plans for the Greater São Paulo and Greater Rio de Janeiro areas are being gradually executed. Essentially all states in Brazil are enforcing the use of face masks and other pertinent precaution measures, now determined by law.\n\n\nUSA and Canada\n\n\nNorth American markets have been very measured during the last almost 90 days, i.e. since the covid19 disruptions and lockdowns have been in place. Several phenomena are noticeable.\n\r\nCurrent executive search and consulting assignments are moving slower as our clients are being very measured about adding to staff and our team’s availability to participate in consulting efforts has been limited. New roles are being actively considered but timing for hiring is still reasonably uncertain. Action oriented consulting on new markets and new approaches to market are moving at a sub-optimal pace.\n\r\nSome of our clients appear to be using the current environment to release their less successful employees and are being incredibly careful to avoid legal risk with re-alignment of functions.\n\r\nOpportunities to revise organizational design and realign functions are being hampered by the lack of certainty.\n\r\nThe recent and continuing racial discord is distracting as corporations and faith communities are taking center stage rather than leadership from national or in some cases, state officials.\n\r\nCautious optimism is just beneath the surface, but the unnecessary distractions must be mitigated.\n\n\n\r\nWe hope that you, your family, and work colleagues continue to stay healthy and safe. We at The Taplow Group are here to support you and your company through this crisis and beyond. We will be back with another update soon.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3254)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

The coronavirus outbreak and the restrictions that followed made organizations switch to the remote working model. All ourexecutive search consultant has adapted to a hybrid remote  working model. This means online interviews and networking have replaced face-to-face and personal connections. Here is an insight into the biggest challenges the executive search consultants are facing in the ‘new normal.’\n\n\n\r\nEven though the \n executive search\n \nhas been affected, yet there lies an opportunity amid every crisis. Many organizations are in search of talent and C-suite leaders who can steer the company towards success during these difficult times.\n\n\n\n\nKey Challenges in the times of COVID19 for Executive Search Consultants\n\n\n\n\nLayoffs\n\r\nMany organizations have taken a severe hit in their profits and have turned to layoffs and cost-cutting to compensate for that. More than 40% of organizations across the US have frozen recruiting employees for their top management and senior positions. The industries that took a major blow are travel, tourism, hospitality, and retail. Now, this can be a good opportunity to extend the network for executive recruitment consultants, further their connections with the top talent in the their sectors.\n\n\n\n\nFinding the right talent\n\r\nIt is becoming a huge challenge to fill in open positions because people are not willing to change jobs or shift from one role to another.

Face to face interviews and live discussions in a meeting room are often not possible. Most \nexecutive search firms\n \nhave digitized the entire recruitment process. Video conferencing, online interviews, and assessments are the near future, and executive consultants have adapted to the digital transformation.\n\n\n\n\nAdopting Technology\n\r\nThe wave of digital transformation brings in many technology shifts. Executive search consultants will need to upskill themselves so that they are well versed with the digital platforms and modern recruitment software. Right now, this entire digitized process might seem a bit overwhelming, but once mastered, it can speed up project outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nEvolving needs of organizations\n\r\nLeadership needs of organizations have changed over the last few months and continue to rapidly evolve . Organizations require leaders who can steer them towards success during these difficult times. There is a huge spike in demand for HR Finance and Operating officer positions in leadership. Executive employees are acting cautiously regarding career changes or company shifts, making things challenging for the \nS\nearch Consultant \nand Companies.\n\n\n\r\nChallenging times bring out the best within us.

Emotionally intelligent people utilize this understanding to manage and reason with people. Although this may seem like an abstract concept, it has very real implications. The concept of EI is gaining traction. Several studies have highlighted the direct impact of bad relationships at the workplace on increasing attrition, decreased employee productivity and general employee dissatisfaction as well.\n\n\n\r\nTraditional thinking regarding workplace dynamics prohibited the expressions at the workplace because of the belief that they hinder work and reduce productivity. However, further studies such as a study of 11 American presidents identified that the key differentiator between successful presidents like Truman, Kennedy, Roosevelt and Ford and the not-so-successful presidents such as Johnson and Carter were the understanding and application of the emotions of self and others, i.e. Emotional Intelligence.\n\n\n\r\nIn fact, the famous Trait theory of Leadership has also identified EI as one of the 4 main Essential traits of a good Leader. The main components of Emotional Intelligence are:\n\n\n\r\n• Social Skills\n\r\n• Self-Awareness and Regulation\n\r\n• Self-Motivation\n\r\n• Empathy\n\n\n\r\nThese are desirable qualities that organizations, nowadays, want their leadership to exhibit. Many organizations view these components as a means of promoting employees from their current roles into significant leadership roles.\n\n\n\n\nHow does EI help in workplaces?\n\r\nThe aspects of EI that contribute towards improving workplace relationships are:\n\n\n\n\nEffective Communication –\n First step of EI is to be a good listener and to understand the people you are talking to. This means a clear understanding of their views and also about what motivates them. A person with such understanding can be more realistic in setting goals and expectations and this also adds to the convincing power of a leader.\n\n\n\n\nConflict management –\n Having the ability to mediate and solve arguments can help a leader maintain relationships and prevent loss of business as well. Being a good negotiator and being able to manage conflicts is one of the crucial requirements in a leader.\n\n\n\n\nManaging stress –\n EI contributes towards an individual’s decision-making process by giving them the ability to understand themselves in a better way and not make any rash and impulsive decisions. Such people can work calmly and keep a check on their impulses in order to maintain workplace relationships.\n\n\n\n\nPromoting teamwork –\n Leaders are generally evaluated based on the performance of their teams. Being able to apply EI to foster better relationships allows the leader to encourage the team to work towards a shared goal and maintains a synergy within the team.\n\n\n\n\nTrust and Integrity –\n As a benefit of fostering better relationships, employees can put more trust in each other and the leader. This promotes camaraderie and a sense of integrity among the team members and makes the work environment better.\n\n\n\r\nApplying EI at a workplace can be instrumental in transforming the environment and promote productivity and efficiency at the workplace. Leaders who understand the needs and emotions of their team and lead by example are far more capable of motivating and guiding employees to work towards a shared organizational goal.\n\r\nConnected and motivated teams are often led by leaders with high emotional intelligence.

    "content": "How Human Capital Affects Organizational Success\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nThursday, August 6, 2020\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHuman capital can be defined as the expertise, skillsets, and attributes possessed by an individual, which in turn creates economic value for the organization. Over the last decade, most organizations have realized that human capital development is crucial to an organization’s performance. Human capital services have emerged as the key to both, wealth creation and gaining sustainable competitive advantage. The concept of knowledge-economy has led to an increase in the percentage of human capital in GDP.\nIntangible assets, especially human capital, affect the market value of organizations in a major way. So there has been a tremendous emphasis on the human capital search to improve the quality of hire. The bars for organizational learning have been raised beyond mandatory e-learning to create a work environment where knowledge is shared and applied in practice. Human capital development can be assessed through\n• Optimization of workforce\n• Leadership quality\n• Accessibility of knowledge\n• Learning capacity\nSome of the factors that are affected by human capital which ultimately leads to organizational success are\n Creativity- \nIn the current global business landscape, it is important for companies to keep on adapting to the present circumstances to accomplish their targets. So, human capital development in every organization should focus on building an innovative workforce.\nKnowledge- \nSuccessful organizations are using knowledge management to scale up their business. Knowledge management is a combination of human capital, information technology, organizational performance, etc. The knowledge and skills of the workforce are directly related to the growth of an organization.\nValue-\nHuman capital search looks for employees who can add value to the organization by being able to design strategic plans and implement them. Proper training and motivation of employees helps to create value and increase productivity.\nCompetitive advantage-\nFor an organization to have a competitive advantage, it should be able to differentiate its products and services from the market solutions. Human capital services ensure that the employees have the required intellect, creativity, and flexibility to deliver quality work which would help the process.\nRetention rate-\nIf the human capital services of an organization are providing existing employees with career advancement opportunities, they will stay in the company. Improved retention rates will increase the number of loyal employees. If a person is working in the same organization for a long duration, he/she will be familiar with the organizational culture and practices and will be able to deliver the output more efficiently.\n Customer satisfaction-\nThe level of customer satisfaction is directly proportional to the quality of human capital. The attitude, experience, and competence of the employees determine the type of service relationship with the customers. Good resources have a high chance of forging a positive relationship with the customers, which would benefit the company both in the short and long run.\nHuman capital development plays an important role in an organization’s growth, productivity, and efficiency. To reap the best benefits from it, every company needs to actively invest in human capital services. Despite the growth in artificial intelligence, human capital still remains very important to an organization because every organization requires human capital to reach their goals.\nAt The Taplow Group we have extensive experience in designing, delivering and benchmarking Human Capital projects in addition to Human Capital Search, to ensure our clients fully realize their employees’ full potential.

Talent development is a program that focuses on developing employee skills and competencies. Keeping the overall career of an employee in mind, the organizations provide opportunities where one can learn and grow. Talent development, also termed as human capital development, can be used as a business strategy to acquire and retain talented individuals within the organization.\n\n\n\r\nThere is always a gap between the organizational requirement and employee knowledge as in today’s VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity and Ambiguity) world the business requirements are very dynamic. Thus, to manage the gap and to assure that the organization has good leadership to flourish in the future, it is extremely important to nurture and develop team talent.\n\n\n\r\nCarefully planned and executed processes of team talent development can ensure a high success rate for both, the project as well as the organization.\n\n\n\r\nHere is the list of top 5 reasons why a leader should focus on team talent development:\n\r\nIt costs 33% of the annual salary of an employee if the leadership replaces him/her with new talent. Thus, it is always the first choice for the leadership to upgrade the knowledge of the existing employee than onboarding a new one. Thus, investing in the development of human capital within the organization leads to a reduced recruitment cost.\n\n\n\r\n74% of the employees are more satisfied and motivated as well as loyal when they feel there is a scope of personal development initiated by the leadership. They feel more connected to leadership when their interests are fulfilled. Talent development ensures a motivated and engaged workforce.\n\n\n\r\nTeam talent development is essential for the continued success of an organization as it provides the right balance of workforce strength required by the leadership, gives opportunities for selecting the right successor, and a huge pool of talent that provides the organization with the luxury of promoting from within.\n\n\n\r\nThere is a phenomenal increase in the productivity and efficiency of the team when the leadership engages in team talent development. If the employees feel that the leadership cares about them and is helping them grow professionally, then the organization will experience reduced absenteeism and improved employee retention.\n\n\n\r\nIf you invest in the human capital of your organization and polish the team talent, then it will be a good payoff while dealing with your customers. There have been many surveys conducted to test the relation between talent development and customer satisfaction. Do you know that a talented and trained staff/employee provides better customer service when compared to inexperienced and non-talented staff? Thus, it is extremely important for the leadership to invest in team talent development to provide better services to the customer.\n\n\n\r\nGood leaders always try to meet the requirements of the team and harness the existing talent. This helps the organization to build a pool of talent, which gives them a competitive edge in the market. At The Taplow Group, we help you find leaders that you seek.

    "content": "Taplow Group – 7th Global Business Overview\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nMonday, July 27, 2020\n/\nCategories: \nNews\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Taplow firms have been active throughout the pandemic, this is the seventh in our Business Updates series from our partners around the world. The situation is showing clear signs of recovery although nuances exist in every country and region.\n\n\nKey Findings:\n\n\nBusiness Leaders\n:\n Have multi strategies in place dealing with the pandemic, near future and long-term strategies whilst many are dealing with local, regional, and international regulations and economies.\n\n\nEmployees:\n \nUncertainty has heightened employees mental health issues, going back to work does not ease those worries employees feel, and clear and regular communication is required from employers to minimise employee welfare issues.\n\n\nCompanies\n:\nAre experiencing differing effects, there is a dichotomy of pandemic effects even within companies in the same market sectors.\n\n\nAFRICA:\n\n\nSouth Africa:\n\n\n• The coronavirus pandemic is accelerating in Africa, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.\n\r\n• The WHO's Africa regional director Matshidiso Moeti said it was spreading beyond capital cities and that a lack of tests and other supplies was hampering responses.\n\r\n• South Africa is experiencing difficulties controlling the pandemic with over 420,000 cases and may head back into a national lockdown.\n\n\nASIA:\n\n\nAustralia:\n\n\n• Recent reporting internationally has included Australia with an increase in community transmission of COVID-19. The situation is that in six (6) of the eight (8) Australian states and territories there are no cases of transmission and there have not been for many weeks and months.\n\r\n• The Australian international border remains closed and many internal state borders remain closed. The Australian circumstances are not unique. The Australian Strategy is suppression of COVID-19 not an elimination strategy. It is targeted at reducing community transmission while international borders are closed. There are four (4) COVID-19 vaccines in human trials in Australia.\n\r\n• The economic update this week advised the Australian Government has committed 14.6% of GDP in economic support. Unemployment is likely to rise to 9.25% in the December quarter 2020. The effective unemployment rate however is falling, and this is a positive sign. Youth unemployment is at its highest rate in 20years. The Job Keeper payment due to expire at the end of September 2020 has been extended with revised conditions.\n\r\n• The equities market has continued to recover to pre COVID-19 levels.\n\n\nIndia:\n\n\n• India has further upped the ante against China by restricting bidders from countries with which it shares land border from participating in tenders for government procurement without approval from competent authorities on the ground of defence and national security.\n\r\n• According to HSBC's Navigator report, almost half (46 percent) of Indian businesses covered under a survey felt 'very strong’ impacted under the Covid-19 impact, yet 54% said they were well prepared as they possibly be.\n\r\n• The survey was conducted on more than 2,600 companies across 14 global markets, including 200 firms in India. Despite the high level of impact faced by Indian businesses, more than a quarter (29%) of those surveyed said they are operating as normal, and this level was second highest across all markets behind Mainland China.\n\r\n• In Indian automotive industry- 2Wheeler demand has reached July 2019 levels, 4wheeler demand is yet to pick up.\n\r\n• Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance breaks into top 50 most valued firms globally, ranks 48- Globally, Saudi Aramco is the company with the highest market cap of USD 1.7 trillion, followed by Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet.\n\r\n• Amazon to Offer Car, Two-Wheeler Insurance in India- Amazon's service will compete with local rivals including Paytm and insurance aggregator Policybazar, which is backed by SoftBank.\n\r\n• Intel to acquire 0.39% stake in Jio Platforms for Rs 1,895 CR; will be 12th firm to invest in Reliance Industries' digital arm. The Intel deal values Jio Platforms at an equity value of Rs 4.91 lakh crore and an enterprise value of Rs 5.16 lakh crore.\n\r\n• E-commerce major Flipkart Group has acquired 100% stake in Walmart India Pvt Ltd, which operates the Best Price cash-and-carry business, and has launched Flipkart Wholesale, a new digital marketplace.: The announcement comes a week after Flipkart said that it had raised $1.2 billion in funding from a Walmart-led investor group.\n\n\nSingapore:\n\n\n• Singapore announces new cabinet effective on Monday 27 July. Mr Lee continues as Prime Minister, saying that he intends to see Singapore through the COVID-19 pandemic as its leader and that the timeline for succession depends on the situation. Mr Lee said the new Cabinet seeks to balance continuity, exposure, and renewal, and be a team that leads Singapore through the current public health and economic crisis and into the future.\n\r\n• The layoffs at Resort World Sentosa last week has shone the spotlight on the rise in retrenchments amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Job losses arising from economic contraction is expected to affect middle-aged and older Singapore workers more adversely. They are usually the first to be retrenched during an economic crisis. Once they lose their jobs, they will likely have difficulty finding another. Today, six in 10 of the Singaporean workforces are 40 years or older. Despite an ageing workforce, Singapore’s productivity has increased by about 30 per cent over the past decade. This has been attributed to Singapore’s march towards automation and digitalisation efforts.\n\r\n• The setting up of the National Jobs Council, plus the various schemes such as SG United Jobs and Skills Package, and Skills Future are all steps in the right direction to help the unemployed find jobs and upskill. The Fair Consideration Framework by Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower for employers to avoid discriminatory hiring practices also signals the Government’s stance on ageism. Five employers were recently penalised in March for age discrimination in hiring.\n\n\nNew Zealand:\n\n\n• The New Zealand economy faces up to two years of consolidation following the COVID-19 pandemic, according to latest economic forecasts.\n\r\n• There is a widespread view that New Zealand’s borders are likely to be effectively closed for the next 12 months which will see the disappearance of international tourism. This alone will knock 5.2% off GDP according to economists.\n\r\n• Domestic travel continues to lift with the national airline back to 70% of the domestic routes it was flying pre Covid1-19. Economists have stated that even if domestic travel restrictions were lifted and Kiwis spent all their overseas holiday money in New Zealand, it would not make up for half of the GDP drop.\n\r\n• It has been reported that 1.5m workers, or 57% of the country’s workforce, are being supported by the government’s wage subsidy scheme which will come to an end on 1st September 2020. This highlights the pressure businesses are under. The sudden loss of key sectors, along with lower spending by firms and households, could potentially have a devastating effect on businesses.\n\r\n• The wage subsidy will limit the immediate rise in the unemployment rate, but a leading economist forecasts that it will still threaten double digits. It will take considerable time for these workers and other resources to be redeployed into other businesses, particularly in an environment where firms will be extremely cautious about hiring.\n\n\nEUROPE:\n\n\nThe EU has agreed a 1€ Trillion recovery fund for its 26 member states, a mixture of loans and grants will be offered to European Countries. This is an important step for the EU as it is the first time the EU has sought to borrow as a bloc. Intensive negotiations resulted in an agreement where countries would not have to start paying back loans until 2028, indeed that is the time the EU will start to work on a process for repayments, many are predicting these loans may not be paid for a decade or longer or never at all.\n\n\nFrance:\n\n\n• Hiring declarations have been on the decline since April, in the face of the Covid-19 crisis. But statistics also show that the situation began to improve between May and the end of June.\n\r\n• In detail, this \"historic\" drop in recruitment concerns three major sectors in particular: services (-45.2% year-on-year), industry (-40.8%) and construction (-29.3%). In addition, the decline in recruitment declarations applies to all regions of France. Even though Île-de-France (- 50.6 %), Corsica (- 49.8 %) and Alsace (- 47.0 %) show the most marked falls. There has been a clear improvement in the situation since the end of the lockdown and in the last weeks of the second quarter. Thus, in June 2020, the level of hiring of more than one month was only 9% lower than a year ago, compared to - 49.5% in May and - 72.2% last April.\n\r\n• While economists fear an explosion in unemployment, and the Banque de France is expecting the loss of a million jobs in 2020, lay-offs are already multiplying. Despite the generalization of short-time working during the lockdown period and transformation into a long-term partial activity, lay-offs are multiplying in particular in construction, trade and automobile repair, manufacturing industry and accommodation and catering, according to the Ministry of Labour.\n\r\n• Two months after the end of the lockdown on 11 May, the French economy has recovered sharply. In June, activity closed 3/5 of the gap that separated it, at the bottom of the lockdown, from its pre-crisis level. Household consumption is now only 3 percentage points from its normal level. While the first steps of the recovery have been climbing quickly since May, it is the last ones that are likely to be the most difficult. Thus, fears \"remain strong\" about a possible second epidemic wave in France, but also about world trade, the epidemic remains highly active in many countries.\n\r\n• The French economy should rebound in the second half of the year. However, industrial companies' order books are still thin, which is not a good sign for an immediate return to normal. France's GDP is expected to fall by 9% in 2020.\n\n\nSweden:\n\n\n• During the spring, several of our customers paused their recruitments due to Covid-19, but in May and June we are happy that the vast majority have been started up again and our customers are looking brighter in the autumn.\n\r\n• We can see that covid-19 has made several interesting and successful candidates now more open to listening and accepting new challenges in the business world.\n\r\n• Interim is hot, when there is great uncertainty among companies, it is easier and faster to bring in a leader or specialist on Interim assignments.\n\r\n• Sweden has not had the decline in industry that can be seen in big part of Europe. The number of new customers has given us the confidence before the summer to start up new projects, which we are incredibly grateful and proud of. The capacity is high internally with us and we work hard to find the perfect match.\n\n\nUK:\n\n\n• The UK government announced a reduction to the pandemic risk, this now sees gyms, leisure centres and many indoor activities reopen on the 25th July.\n\r\n• Retail sector has seen turnover return in June 2020 to pre lockdown levels.\n\r\n• Separately, a closely watched survey showed that activity in the UK's services and manufacturing sectors returned to growth last month.\n\r\n• The UK government committed to introducing “local lockdowns” where Covid infection spikes are seen, the government now is giving local authorities the data to make informed decisions on the pandemic.\n\n\nAMERICAS:\n\n\nThe Americas have seen a surge of Covid-19 cases, the worry is that this is occurring in the Summer months and will exacerbate healthcare’s ability to deal with cases as the flu season approaches. Canada is the only country seeing a reduction in cases and significant amount of lockdown rules being eased.\n\n\nBrazil:\n\n\n• According to CEPAL, the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, pre-pandemic 2020 Latin America economy forecast had shown a modest 1.3% growth for the region, versus current -9.1% estimate. 18 million jobs will have disappeared in the area because of the pandemic. Prior to Covid-19, Argentina’s economy had been severely affected and saw significant decrease in its exports to China and to other countries.\n\r\n• Brazil continues to see an important recovery in the consumer/retail and essential services sectors, having achieved a 14% growth from April 2020 to the present, although that month is considered a low basis. Those sectors are still 7% below February 2019. Other economic sectors performing above expectations are the agribusiness – current grain super crop records, which represents about 35% of total economy, and the real estate industry in the lower level niches. Interest rates are now in better shape. Brazil expects to see a better second semester this year.\n\r\n• Following last year’s new Social Security Law in place, Tax reform is now on the go; it is expected that discussions in the Congress will start in the third quarter of this year.\n\r\n• Although Covid-19 still remain active in higher levels than predicted, the Northern and Northeastern areas of the country seem to be well under control now; States of São Paulo and Rio seem to have reached a still high plateau, but disease seem to be under control; the worse areas now are the South and Central states and the Interior of the State of São Paulo. The recovery plans for the Greater São Paulo and Greater Rio de Janeiro areas are being gradually executed. Essentially all states in Brazil are enforcing the use of face masks and other pertinent precaution measures, now determined by law. We reached the second millionth infected case and about 77 thousand deaths in the country. Fortunately, there are no panic or critical/hospitality collapsing situations.\n\n\nUSA:\n\n\n• Unemployment, Pandemic and Political strife continue to dominate the news in the Americas. Medical experts insist we are not having a second wave of the virus, but the first wave is still uncontained. Continued increases in virus infections are occurring in several state who have tried “re-opening” and have been mixed with some states not having experienced much in the way of the early stage (Arizona) and others pounded by the first wave (California).\n\n\n. Business has adjusted to the new normal of working from home and a surprising number of firms have reported that they will make no effort to fully re-open until next year – prepared for less than 100% of employees willing or able to return. We are not aware of any clients who have experienced enough personnel losses due to the pandemic to put their business at risk although we know of smaller firms who are contemplating how to proceed due to staff losses to the virus.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3192)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

The relevance of human capital development has emerged to be of utmost importance in these changing times. Human capital can be defined as the expertise, skillsets, and attributes possessed by an individual, which in turn creates value for the organization. \n Human capital development\n empowers people to work in a way that creates a long-lasting value for the enterprise. Human capital development capitalizes on the knowledge derived from the workforce to maximize their potential and productivity at work. Many researches have been conducted, which highlight the fact that the financial performance of the organization is directly affected by human capital services.\nHuman capital helps organizations to adapt to constant changes. But the advent of new technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning is perceived as a challenge in the human capital services domain. However, as the world faces the global pandemic, now would be the right time to combine technology and human capital to create greater value. The companies are facing a new challenge of managing their workforce remotely, where the employees are hardly exposed to organizational culture and environment. To transcend this situation, human capital development has become more important. The main focus of human capital development should be\n• Instill a sense of belonging to the organization so that the productivity of human capital increases.\n• Help in improving the skillset of the workforce to make them relevant to the era of digitalization\n• Maximize the potential of the human capital to think creatively and innovatively, aligning with the organization culture\n• Monitor the wellbeing of the workers, taking care of their health, safety, career growth, and personal aspirations. Remote monitoring might be a challenge, but it is critical for organizational performance\n• Redesign the work environment by considering the challenges faced in working remotely, allow flexible working hours to ensure employee satisfaction\nA very crucial problem that the human capital services will face is to address the mentality and adaptability to the new normal across different demography. It is important to find out strategies or training programs that would cater to employee attributes individually as well as in small groups. Another concern is the waning of team spirit due to the physical distance which has been created. Human capital services need to find engaging workspace activities to rekindle the team spirit.\nLastly, human capital is an integral part of the foundation of every organization. So, conducting a proper human capital search for each job will help the organization become more resilient in this pandemic situation.\nAt The Taplow Group we have extensive experience in designing, delivering and benchmarking Human Capital projects in addition to Human Capital Search, to ensure our clients fully realize their employees’ full potential.

    "content": "Executive Development in the Digital Age by Barbara Liebermeister, Founder and Managing Director of the IFIDZ, Germany\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nFriday, July 3, 2020\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping leaders requires a systematic approach, particularly in the digital age. As rapid change sets the pace and predictability is diminishing, leadership is becoming ever more important so that employees can be given the necessary stability and guidance. At the same time, leadership needs to become more agile, motivating and inspiring. So, in addition to developing new competences, executives also need to be more flexible and be able to self-reflect, as well as willing to learn and to change their behaviour, if necessary.\n\n\nThis attitude and the necessary competences are generally not covered in traditional executive development programmes. And not only the content requires a new approach – the traditional format of seminars or workshops, followed by learning on the job, also needs an overhaul: modern information and communication technologies also provide an opportunity to create new, innovative learning structures.\n\n\nConceptualising such new development programmes can be difficult for personnel development managers. Often, they lack digital competence themselves. They don’t know which learning structures are technically possible and make sense to be included, and they struggle to anticipate the future needs of the company and its employees. As a consequence, they need to rely on the support of external consultants or their IT department which makes it difficult for them to contribute their expertise to the company’s digital transformation.\n\n\n \n\n\nMulti-step approach\n\n\nWhen developing new executive development programmes that fulfil the requirements of today’s environment, a multi-step process is recommended.\n\n\nAs a first step, the development manager and his internal customers – across functions and hierarchies should get together to define their joint understanding of the basic leadership principles in the digital age and the respective change required with regard to the desired corporate and leadership culture. This provides a basis for determining the needs for change, and aligning on the core objectives of the new executive development.\n\n\nThe result may be that a programme should cover the key competences required for leading in the digital age. Or the programme needs to address behavioural aspects for participants to be able to assume the different leadership roles (leader, enabler and empowerer). Or the programme should focus on covering essential leadership instruments and tools needed in the future.\n\n\nWhatever the objective – alignment of the existing leaders within the company is key. A common leadership culture can only emerge, when there is a general and crossfunctional understanding on all levels of the core components of leadership, such as values or the image of the human being – regardless of an executive’s respective personality, function and leadership style.\n\n\nAs a next step, the development needs in a company at various divisional levels need to be analysed. There are different ways of doing this. One common approach consists of structured interviews with executives on the medium and top level. However, it is recommended to also include executives on the operative level and at least selected members of staff. For one thing, this means that leaders also receive feedback from the levels below on their leadership style and behaviour, giving them a sense for their own need for change. Secondly, it can serve as a signal to employees that they have an opportunity to contribute to shaping the leadership culture.\n\n\n \n\n\nElements of executive development \n\n\nNow the future executive development programme can be put together. In the digital age, it is essential that online and face-to-face training are combined, applying modern information and communication technology in an effective and meaningful manner. At the same time, the structure needs to be flexible. Framework conditions and the current state of technology are evolving constantly, so in order to ensure the expediency of the programme, the structure needs to be reviewed and possibly adjusted as time progresses.\n\n\nIn general, modern executive development programmes combine the following elements:\n\n\n\n\nCollective qualification (seminars, workshops, webinars, learning platforms). Here, participants are taught the skills they need for leading people in the digital age. The joint learning experience ensures the necessary alignment.\n\n\nIndividual qualification (coaching, mentoring). Participants learn the behavioural flexibility they need to fulfil their leadership function and strengthen their self-confidence as a leader.\n\n\nTransfer supporting measures (team coaching, knowledge sharing). These ensure that participants actually display the desired leadership behaviour and that a leadership culture is developing that meets the needs of the digital age.\n\n\nLearning on the job. This systematically expands the new leadership competences and turn them into routine.\n\n\n\n\nThe share of the different elements within the overall programme will vary, of course. For junior managers who still need to learn the basics of leadership, collective qualification will prevail. The more experienced participants are, the more the training measures need to be tailored to their individual needs.\n\n\n \n\n\nEnsuring buy-in across all functions and hierarchies\n\n\nOnce the new programme has been finalised, it should be presented and explained to all executives in a joint meeting. This will ensure a common understanding across all functions, making sure that everyone is aware that change is necessary and what it will look like.\n\n\nOften, such a presentation is not enough to create the necessary enthusiasm and dynamics. Therefore, it makes perfect sense to conduct a self-reflection exercise using a competence analysis tool – either just before or after the meeting. This will provide all executives with an individual analysis of their digital-oriented level of leadership maturity, giving them input for their individual development. On that basis, they can then agree individual development objectives that are in line with their needs as leaders as well as the needs of the company.\n\n\nHowever one thing must not be forgotten, which is just like the executive development programme itself, these agreements also need to be flexible. In a Vuca world, everything is of a preliminary nature, based on the current common level of knowledge. Therefore, it’s key for leaders to remain in constant contact with their staff in order to modify and adjust these agreements as and when needed.\n\n\n \n\n\nAUTHOR\n\n\nBarbara Liebermeister\n\r\nBarbara Liebermeister heads the Institute for Leadership Culture in the Digital Age (IFIDZ) in Frankfurt.

Quoted in the 2020 Executive Recruiting - State of the Industry Report.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nWednesday, July 1, 2020\n/\nCategories: \nNews\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Firth, Chair of The Taplow Group and Managing Partner UK, points out that executive search is almost inherently impacted by disruptions in the global economy as well as political and other major changes which create uncertainty. “It is too early to gauge the medium-term financial impact but our client surveys show that Q1 and Q2 2020 are well below the same periods last year,” says Mr. Firth. “We have seen a few markets really challenged due to lack of control of the virus, particularly in the Americas and Africa. Typically, as the path to ‘normalcy’ becomes visible, our business is a bit ahead of the curve as clients seek to implement their plans.”\n\n\n\r\nImprovement is most likely to be market by market and very fragmented , says Mr. Firth. “Some of the earlier responders such as New Zealand may see an uptick quickly,” he says. “Large economic markets who delayed responding or tried going back to \"business as usual\" too quickly will be quite delayed in coming out of the economic downturn and the global markets require those major players to be active for the rest of the world to see growth. Singapore is a good example of first, getting ahead of the virus and is now is slowly exiting a second lockdown period, this affects business confidence, which is key factor in any sector. An added ‘wild card’ is government stimulus packages that are now being announced and the unpredictable nature of this virus. In the USA as well as several other countries, the political environment and  added uncertainty is also a question directly related to economic disruptions.”\n\n\n\r\nThe Taplow Group has been practicing social distancing and all our employee have been working, from home throughout this period and are now returning to a more normal work environment. “In a few shut-down markets it is apparent that our consultants and clients are adjusting to the new conditions and gradually increases in business velocity are being felt,” says Mr. Firth. “Most importantly, we are taking the time to have personal contact – remotely – with our clients and friends to ensure we and they are ready to face the challenges that no doubt lie ahead. We are helping our clients to focus on growing ‘post-pandemic and discussing strategies that will see their businesses flourish in the coming months and years.” Click \nhere\n to know more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (4990)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

More than 65% of the senior managers, C-suite leaders, and top management executives believe that executive coaching is the best way to propel success.\n\n\nWhat is Leadership Development Coaching?\n\n\nIt is a program that allows leaders to discover their leadership skills, develop increased empathy and self-awareness, and find out areas of improvement. It is not related to the business processes or technical competencies of an individual. Executive coaches guides leader in a step-by-step manner on a path of self-discovery and emotional intelligence. The executives become self-aware and discover their path for the future.\n\n\nLet us discuss some of the incredible benefits of Leadership Coaching\n\n\nEmotional Intelligence\n\r\nLeadership Development leads to a better understanding of one’s self and emotions. Emotional Intelligence is not only about an individual’s emotions but also about the emotions of others around him. A leader must be self-aware, have a deep understanding of his emotions, how they react, how they respond to situations around him, and how it impacts performance.\n\n\n\n\nIntrospection & Open Thinking\n\r\nWhen something goes wrong, you need to introspect and reflect. A leader must introspect further and find the root cause of the problem. Leadership development coaches would push them to reflect on the problems, discover their root cause, bring new ideas to the table, and find the best solution.\n\r\nCoaching would help an individual to look deep inside one’s thought processes. Leadership demands deep and flexible thinking. With an open mind, a person can make precise decisions, execute them effectively, and come out of any difficult or tough situation.\n\n\n\n\nMotivation\n\r\nMotivation is essential for productivity and success at the workplace. It drives employees to adapt to difficult situations, long work hours, and high-pressure conditions. An effective coach would help an individual to become internally motivated. Once a person becomes self-aware and self-regulated, motivation automatically kicks in. Without internal motivation, there would not be any workforce at all.\n\n\n\n\nImproved Communication\n\r\nCommunication is twice about listening than about expressing. Leadership coaching would make leaders become a better listener. They inculcate the habit of active and reflexive listening. Further, coaches teach how to articulate ideas, beliefs, and vision in an effective manner so that others also resonate with your thoughts. Effective communication connects leaders with their team members and establishes credibility.\n\n\n\n\nBetter Performance\n\r\nIt all comes down to a person’s performance at work. Increased levels of productivity and better performance will take your organization to newer heights. With leadership coaching, leaders improve self-performance, the performance of the team members, and, thus, the overall performance of the organization.\n\n\n\n\nLeadership development coaching\n has helped thousands of leaders across the world. It had a profound impact on leaders and their teams. Undoubtedly, it is imperative for an organization’s success. It is not an event but a journey of a lifetime. To gain that competitive edge, to stay ahead of the curve, you must invest in leadership development coaching.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (8459)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

The situation is showing clear signs of recovery although nuances exist in every country and region.\n \nKey Findings:\n \n \nBusiness Leaders:\n \nWith re-start plans under way across sectors, leaders are watchful of subsequent “virus waves” and revising their plans to carry on working if sub regional lockdowns occur.\n \n​\nEmployees: \nThose who have restarted work are juggling employer and Government advisory notices with delivering within their roles. There is a growing impatience from those still in lockdown and Governments seem to be experiencing restlessness across workforces to return to work.\n \n \nCompanies:\n \nPositive signs from countries that have ensured they were active in locking down their countries, point to a V shape recovery. Problematic recovery is seen where Governments are not controlling the virus and economic indicators point to an L shape economy in 2020 with hopes of a bounce back in 2021. \n \n \n \nAFRICA:\n \nSouth Africa:\n \n \n \nThe pandemic is seeing countries in Africa going into various versions of “lockdown”.\n \n \n \nThe business community is striving to come to terms with the situation with the backdrop of little or in some countries no assistance. \n \n \n \nAlthough Africa has not seen as many cases primarily due to there being less travel spreading the pandemic, there are notable clusters emerging. \n \n \n \nASIA: \nAustralia:\n \n \nProgress continues to be made in Australia on economic recovery and movement.  Several state borders have been opened for travel internally.\n \nThere continues to be some community transmission of Covid-19 that is untraceable, and this is slowing progress for a return of office workers. Major Central Business Districts continue to have Government directives to work from home if you can. Traffic has noticeably increased indicating there is increased movement of people for work.\n \nThe equities markets continue to rally towards pre Covid-19 levels. June 30th is the end of the Australian financial year. Companies and individuals will be finalising\n    affairs for this. There have been some indications Government will continue the fiscal and economic stimulus, particularly with the reporting that employment has reached 7.1% nationally.\n \nThere were some protests held in major Australian cities that resulted in large gatherings of protesters. The timing of the protests has been questioned when the health of the Australian people has been such a high priority. Major sporting codes have resumed competition with crowd attendance at the stadiums.\n \n \nAustralia’s international borders remain closed with very limited air travel services available.\n \n \n \nIndia:\n \n \nIndia, the third largest oil consumer, expects fuel demand to return to normal earlier than projections by the International Energy Agency and OPEC. At the end of June, India has already achieved 85% of demand compared to June 2019.\n \nFor defence procurement, the Government has enhanced the FDI limit through the automatic route from 49% to 74% to help global players to set up manufacturing facilities within the country and thereby supplement the domestic manufacturing capabilities.\n \n​\nAs a positive indicator, Reverse Migration has started in India i.e. several trains bound for major Indian cities housing Industrial complexes have started running with over 100% booking, since migrant workers are coming back to work showing signs of revival of economic engine.\n \nIndia’s first Payment bank - Airtel Payments Bank's revenues rose 87 per cent to Rs 474 crore during FY20, driven by surge in digital payments, money transfer and offtake of new services, The Payments Bank sees a \"massive headroom for growth\" and its promoters remain committed to unlocking this potential.\n \n​\nIndian Government is planning to launch Bharat Craft, an e-commerce portal, on the lines of Alibaba, and should soon see turnover on the platform to the tune of Rs 10 lakh crore in the next few years and this would benefit MSMEs in a big way. State Bank of India is working on setting up an e-commerce portal for marketing of products manufactured by micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the country. The bank and the Government would jointly run the portal called Bharat Craft.\n \n \nSingapore:\n \n \nUp to S$920 million has been set aside to extend foreign worker levy rebates for firms in the construction, marine shipyard, and process sectors until the end of 2022. This will help these industries cope with significant higher costs of implementing safe management measures at workplaces.\n \n \nA Fair Tenancy Pro Tem Committee under the Singapore Business Federation, SBF has been set up to develop a tenancy framework to deal with current and long-term issues, as well as establish industry norms on tenancy practices and terms between retail tenants and landlords. The formation of this new committee comes after months of simmering tension between retail tenants and their landlords.\n \n \nSingapore’s manufacturing output fell 7.4 per cent year-on-year in May after two straight months of increase as demand weakened across most segments, with only the biomedical manufacturing cluster reporting gains. Excluding this cluster, the country’s output fell 10.4 per cent.\n \n​\nSingaporean’s will be heading to the polling station on 10th July. This comes shortly after the announcement by the Singapore Government to dissolve the Parliament last week, paving way for the elections to be held just as Singapore emerges from Phase 2 Circuit Breaker.\n \n \nNew Zealand:\n \n \nBNZ (one of New Zealand’s major banks) states that it is fortunate New Zealand is so exposed to the Asian region (especially China) and less exposed to the “old-world” countries of the United States, Europe, and United Kingdom. To put this in perspective, at the end of the June quarter, US economic activity is forecast to be 10.7% down on year earlier levels. Over the same period, the UK takes a 15.9% hit and the Eurozone 15.8%. Compare this with China +1.2% (though admittedly, its big hit was in Q1 when the annual decline was 6.8%), Korea -2.2% and Taiwan -2.2%. Putting all this together, New Zealand’s trading partner activity decline troughs at an annual -5.5%.\n \nAccording to BNZ forecasts, New Zealand doesn’t get back to its pre-Covid starting point until Q3, 2022 but BNZ concedes that there are upside risks to its GDP growth view. To start with, BNZ has weaker-than-consensus expectations for New Zealand activity. BNZ is forecasting a contraction of 8.0% for calendar 2020 followed by a bounce of 4.8% in 2021. The consensus view is -6.1% and +5.9% respectively. Secondly, if the trading partner forecasts that are being espoused prove accurate and, in particular, if China takes off in the manner assumed, then it may be that New Zealand’s export performance will turn out to be stronger than BNZ has anticipated.\n \n​\nDomestic air travel capacity in New Zealand continues to recover with expectations that it will recover to just under 80% of its pre-Covid-19 levels by the end of 2020.\n \n \nEUROPE:\nThe EU region has seen a remarkable recovery in the past few weeks, Governments have reopened borders with neighbouring countries and regionally business life is returning in stages with positive results. Recent changes to regulations by the EU look to have saved Europeans “Summer Vacation plans” which are incredibly important for Southern European nations. \n \nFrance:\n \n \nThe French economy is expected to experience one of the worst recessions in the world in 2020, according to the new forecasts of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which now anticipates a 12.5% drop in 2020, compared to 7.2%, initially announced in April, in its latest global forecast. A recession close to that of Italy (-12.8%) and Spain (-12.8%). \n \nIMF anticipates a rebound in growth for France at 7.3% in 2021, a figure close to that expected by the Banque de France (7%). This would be one of the strongest growth rates among developed countries. France is thus ahead of the United States (+4.5%), Germany (+5.4%), Italy (+6.3%) and Spain (+6.3%), according to IMF forecasts. However, \"this apparent strong rebound would not allow the level of activity at the end of 2019 to be restored before mid-2022,\" the French central bank has already warned.\n \n​\nThe business climate in France recovered significantly in June, although it is still at a low level, according to data published on June the 23rd by the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE), the synthetic indicator of the business climate in France gained 18 points in June, to 78. If it \"exceeds the level of the trough reached in March 2009 (70)\", it \"remains well below its long-term average (100),\" INSEE said. The rebound in the indicator \"is explained in particular by the more optimistic view that companies have of their business prospects, in all sectors, under the effect of the deconfinement,\" says the INSEE.\n \n \nThe deconfinement having \"mechanically led to a recovery in employment in a number of sectors\", these figures \"are a sign of a gradual recovery in activity, but the situation remains difficult\", the Labour Ministry stresses in a press release. Another indicator suggesting that the recovery is beginning on the French labour market, reports of hiring for more than a month in the private sector, excluding interim workers, jumped 75.9% in May in France, after two months of sharp decline.\n \n \n \nTo accompany the recovery, while trying to spare public finances heavily impacted by the measures put in place to try to avoid an explosion in the unemployment rate, the Government has notably decided to lighten the health protocol imposed on companies since June the 22d and is changing the partial coverage of activity with new regulation that will start from the first of July. Discussions are also under way with the social partners to change the unemployment insurance rules. \n \n \n \nGermany:\n \n \n \nLufthansa gets funding of 9 billion EUROs to support the aircraft sector.\n \n \n \nThe Government's economic stabilisation fund is to acquire 20 per cent of Lufthansa shares worth 300 million euros, plus two silent partnerships worth 5.7 billion euros. Three billion euros will be borne by the development bank KfW. In addition, the Federal Government will be represented on the Supervisory Board through two mandates, whereby the mandates will be awarded to independent experts.\nThe EU Commission's competition authorities have released the Lufthansa rescue package. However, the EU Commission has made its approval subject to conditions. The release of the recapitalization aid in the amount of six billion euros is subject to the condition that the largest German airline complies with obligations to avoid distortions of competition. These include that Lufthansa must relinquish take-off and landing rights at its main locations in Frankfurt (Main) and Munich.\n \n \n \nAt The Taplow Group Germany, Clients are reviewing their HR-strategy for 2020 and are starting to hire again – e.g. Electrical engineering and IT-companies. Others are planing to hire from September again.\n \n \n \nRussia:\n \n \n \nWith the daily infection rate slowly decreasing since the beginning of June, Russia is further easing restrictions, and more companies are starting to shift back to working from the office. The country is now also allowing a one-time entrance to foreigners that are holding a highly qualified specialist Visa (HQS). This is an incredibly positive and essential step for businesses, as many expatriate General Managers were not able to return to Russia before this.\n \n \n \nLike in many other countries, the automation and robotics industry was able to grow during the time of pandemic due to the high and urgent demand of mask and disinfectant producers to increase production capacities. Furthermore, we can see the trend towards automation growing in Russia in other industries as well. For example the first fully automated “no-contact” KFC opened in Moscow this month. Other sectors like pumps and pipelines have not been affected by Covid-19, but the ongoing low oil prices are influencing their business negatively. The fashion retail industry did suffer losses during the pandemic; however, leisure and sportswear producers were able to stabilise and, in some cases, even increase their business due to strong online business and advanced delivery services. In general, companies in Russia are trying their level best to keep their staff and are aiming at returning to business by the autumn and also restart recruitments by then.\n \n \n \nTaplow Russia is receiving more requests for targeted salary research by local subsidiaries, as the salary statistics provided by the headquarters are too general and not specific enough for crucial positions. Salaries in Russia are varying a lot with wide ranges strongly dependent on the Region. Hence a general overview can seldomly showcase the real picture.\n \n \n \nSpain:\n \n \n \nSpain will be one of the countries that will suffer the greatest recessions among the main advanced economies and emerging markets.\n \n \n \n12.8% contraction in gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020.\n \n \n \nCEOE gives green light to the extension of the ERTE (Temporary Employment Regulation Scheme) until 30 September.\n \n \n \nUK:\n \n \nThe UK Government announced a reduction to the pandemic risk. This now sees retail, holiday venues, cinemas and importantly restaurants and pubs reopening from July 4th – dubbed as “UK Independence Day” by the media.\n \n \nThe airline industry is restarting but the Government’s 14 day “self-Isolation” scheme on entering the UK will severely restrict the travel industry to relaunch. There are plans being announced to form “Air Corridors” with EU and other European Countries. This will see UK summer holidays being saved along with a return to European business travel in Q3 2020.\n \n \n \nRecruitment sector has returned. Many projects that were “stopped” have been reactivated and some businesses are starting to reassess their growth strategies now as they can see how the business has survived in the lockdown period.\n \n \n \nAMERICAS:\nLatin America is the latest centre of the pandemic, North America is seeing signs of recovery but with numerous states seeing a rise in pandemic numbers, the situation could deteriorate quickly without clear leadership and plans.  \n \nBrazil:\n \n \nBrazil is seeing its fourth month of the pandemic impact. Number of cases and deaths are relatively high, comparable to the countries of highest indexes in Europe, but still below the US, in terms of absolute numbers.  The State of São Paulo responsible for a little over 20% of all cases in Brazil, both in infected population and in deaths started its gradual, well-structured recovery plan back starting June 15th. There is no collapse of medical or hospital/intensive care attendance, but only in a few cases in the Northern area some weeks ago.\n \n \nThe Brazilian economy has shrunk 6% in March and another 10% in April, according to bona fide sources. The numbers for the month of May are still being analyzed but should not be worse than April. According to the INC (Industry National Confederation), in May, the country has seen more industrial activity, an almost regular activity in the field. As a matter of fact, our crop this year will be a all times harvest record, estimated to reach 246.4 million tons of cereals, leguminous, and oleaginous crops, higher than 241.5 million tons in 2019.\n \n \n \nOur official annual interest rate/SELIC  has dropped to 2.25%, and our current annual deflation rate is -1.6%, the smallest rate since 1979,  due to the current stage of depression. In fact, our 2019 unfinished recession was hit by this current pandemic recession.\n \n \n \nCurrent key world-wide and our own strategic concern points out to the potential, eventual second Covid-19 pandemic wave and its consequences to the world economies.\n \n \n \nUSA and Canada:\n \n \nNorth American markets have been very measured during the last almost 90 days since the COVID19 disruptions and lockdowns have been in place. Several phenomena are noticeable.\n \n \nCurrent executive search and consulting assignments are moving slower as our clients are being very measured about adding more staff and team availability to participate in consulting efforts has been limited.  New roles are being actively considered but timing for hiring is still reasonably uncertain.  Action oriented consulting on new markets and new approaches to market are moving at a sub-optimal pace.\n \n \n \nSome of our clients appear to be using the current environment to release their less successful employees and are being incredibly careful to avoid legal risk with re-alignment of functions.\n \n \n \nOpportunities to revise organizational design and realign functions are being hampered by the lack of certainty.\n \n \n \nThe recent and continuing racial discord is distracting as corporations and faith communities are taking center stage rather than leadership from national or in some cases, state officials.\n \n \n \nCurfews and “stay at home” orders are still in places in some areas causing significant distractions.\n \n \n \nThe news of this week about an increased rate of new COVID19 cases is not surprising as the lifting of “lock downs” is now elapsed for over 14 days.\n \n \n \nCautious optimism is just beneath the surface, but the unnecessary distractions must be mitigated.\n \n \n \n \n \nWe hope that you, your family, and work colleagues continue to stay healthy and safe. We at The Taplow Group are here to support you and your company through this crisis and beyond. We will be back with more updates soon!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3187)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

It is defined as the economic value derived from the workforce's skills, experience, and expertise. Human Capital also encompasses human virtues like punctuality, integrity, and honesty. Human Capital Development is fundamental to the growth and success of any organization. It increases employee satisfaction, productivity, performance, and thereby the ROI of the firm. Many business leaders say that investing in human capital is probably the best investment an organization can make.\nWith the global pandemic impacting the entire world, \nhuman capital search services\n are also experiencing a plethora of change. It is becoming more and more challenging to find the best talent for any job position. Depending upon the industry, a successful recruitment can take anywhere from 2-6 months.\nIt would help if you had innovative solutions and thorough research to build a highly motivated team. Human capital consultants precisely render this service – they will help you in building your human capital. These professional consultants understand the current market, your business processes, and thus, strategize in scouting, recruiting, developing, and retaining the best talents. It gives you more time and energy to focus on your mainstream business while leveraging human capital services to build the most effective pool of human resources.\nThe 'new normal' brings in a lot of changes and challenges in human capital services. The growing importance of technology, digital know-how, and remote connectivity is shaping trends in the human capital industry. The work environment is continuously getting digitalized. As per a PWC report, more than 55% of the jobs in the coming years would be automated. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning will find high value in every sector and industry. Do you have a workforce to stand this change and upskill themselves in this digital world?\nTalking about the biggest challenge in this virtual world is cultural mapping. Previously, when all employees use to work under the same roof, there was more alignment towards a universal organization culture. But with remote working, it becomes complicated to align the organization culture with the culture of every nation or community. Human Capital consultants need to understand how these cultural differences can fit the firm's overall business culture.\nFinally, owning to remote working and contractual services, the gig economy is on the rise. In this knowledge-based economy, freelancing is preferred over full-time jobs; flexible work hours are preferred over fixed timings. This gives an excellent opportunity for staff augmentation. You can access the best talents across the world, bring in fresh, innovative ideas to the table, reduce recruitment costs, and dynamically augment your team as per your need.\nAt this juncture, you need to ask, 'how can I ensure that my organization's workforce strategy is aligned with the future?' Take help from human capital search services. In the 'new normal,' they will help you overcome the challenges and help you leverage human capital opportunities to the fullest.\nAt The Taplow Group we have extensive experience in designing, delivering and benchmarking Human Capital projects in addition to Human Capital Search, to ensure our clients fully realize their employees’ full potential.

    "content": "Defining The Role of Executive Search Consultants in Talent Acquisition\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nFriday, June 19, 2020\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExecutive Search Consultants help in sourcing the best candidates for the senior level positions or the C-suite level jobs. For these top positions, a company cannot seek help from the typical recruitment agencies. They do not have the expertise and experience in recruiting senior management candidates. The C-suite leaders drive business and are responsible for the growth, expansion, and profits of the company. A small mistake can cost millions. \n Executive recruitment consultants\n can create the difference between a flourishing business and a major catastrophe.\nSo, how do these consultants operate? Executive search consultants have a vast pool of contacts, and their teams specialize in different industries. When you approach them for hiring for a senior position, they strategize and monitor the end-to-end process. These consultants study your organization, understand the current talent pool, get a thorough idea about the job role and the organization culture. They work in close association with their clients. Right from monitoring the interview process till helping you with the employee growth and retention, these consultants have got it all covered.\nThis role demands critical thinking, extensive research, awareness about the present market scenario, and excellent time and project management skills. You would never find this combination in any regular recruitment agency. Let us elaborate on the role of executive search consultants further to make you understand why you should invest in executive search.\n• Most of these consultants have a global network of potential candidates. You get to access the best and most talented professional for your open positions.\n• You get complete discretion in this process. Advertising in the print media cannot fill c-suite roles. There has to be complete confidentiality in the process. By hiring executive search consultants, you not only relieve yourself of this responsibility but also have full control and knowledge about the entire process.\n• Senior positions cannot be filled very frequently. It would be best if you had long-term employees for such a post. By engaging an executive search firm, you ensure that you have the right person who can stay for a long tenure and contribute effectively towards future business growth.\n• You bring diversity in your senior leadership. An executive search would balance and bring in a lot of variety to your C-suite. They would conduct extensive research, broaden the outlook, and select the best person without any biases.\n• The entire recruitment process is a big deal. Identifying talents to finally hiring a person involves a lot of time, money, and resources. With executive recruitment consultants, you save the time and resources required for the hiring process.\nThe present COVID-19 situation further highlights the importance of executive search consultants. Finding the best talent is a daunting task, as most executives don’t want to risk their present jobs. At the same time, the popularity of the gig economy and the global pandemic is affecting the talent pool and the job market. These changing times pose a lot of challenges and to sail through these difficult times; you need the most professional executive search service for your business.\nAt The Taplow Group we help you source the best-fit for your organization’s leadership through our executive search consultants.

    "content": "The Changing Face of Human Capital Development\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nFriday, June 12, 2020\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Capital is the knowledge, experience, competencies, skills, and virtues possessed by the workforce. It is the economic value of the entire workforce of an organization. Thus, \nHuman Capital Development\n is a continuous process to improve the performance and productivity of your employees. If the question is, ‘how do you make your workforce more efficient and effective?’, then human capital development is the answer.\nHuman Capital Development involves everything starting from training and on-the-job learning to team talent development and physical well-being. Undoubtedly, it is the most valuable investment that you can make. Investing in human capital would increase productivity, employee retention, long-term associations, better client relationships, and bring more creativity and innovation at work.\nBut how do you ensure that you are on the right track? Here are four easy steps to ensure that you don’t miss out on anything\n• First, estimate the ROI of your human capital. This can be calculated by dividing the organization’s profit by the investments made on the human capital.\n• Discover the strength and weaknesses of your current workforce. It involves analysis at the organization, operation, and individual levels.\n• Identify areas where you need to invest in human capital. This can be recruitment, training, personality development, career coaching, and likewise.\n• Develop metrics and monitor the investments made for the development of your human capital.\nIn this world of globalization and digital disruption, change is the only constant. Like every other thing, even the face of human capital development is undergoing a significant transformation. To keep yourself updated, you need to familiarize yourself with the changing face of social capital development.\nIncreased Competition\nWith the decreasing unemployment rate, there is a real shortage of talented people in the job market. The workforce looks at the brand name, identity, benefits, work-life balance, and other factors before taking up a job.\nTechnology\nTechnology is changing the way we live, eat, breathe and work. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are automating a major chunk of traditional jobs. This is giving rise to new roles and responsibilities. If your workforce is not technologically updated, then you would lose out in the race. Organizations must invest in the digital up skilling of their employees.\nLeaders of tomorrow\nOrganizations are investing in their human capital to build their future leaders. The various training programs, leadership assessments, and continuous monitoring are to identify the future leadership of the company.\nTeam Talent Development\nGone are the days of silo heroes; today, you have to work in a team and contribute towards the organization’s goals. Human capital development should focus on developing team spirit, talents required to work productively in a team, and encourage employees to think beyond their personal goals.\nAs an organization, you must be aware of these trends that will impact human capital development in the near future. There exists and immediate need to become more innovative and expansive.\nAt The Taplow Group we have extensive experience in designing, delivering and benchmarking Human Capital projects in addition to Human Capital Search, to ensure our clients fully realize their employees’ full potential.

    "content": "Taplow Group – 5th Pandemic Business Overview\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nMonday, June 8, 2020\n/\nCategories: \nNews\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Taplow firms have been active throughout the pandemic. This is the fifth in our Business Updates from our partners around the world. The situation is showing clear signs of recovery although nuances exist in every country and region.\n \nKey Finding\n \nBusiness Leaders\n:\n As business restarts after lockdown, leaders are grappling with new business practices and employee welfare, security, and roles in the workplace. Inspirational leaders are focused on ensuring their teams feel part of an important stage in the company’s development and clearly understand the business strategy and that it is understood and embraced.\nEmployees:\n Employees are dealing with restarting work. Family security is another factor that’s causing stress. Following long periods of working from home or being furloughed, returning to working life causes mental welfare issues and organisations should show empathy, support, and embrace colleges concerns.\nCompanies\n:\n Companies are dealing with post Covid19 regulations, reigniting their business that are often unrecognisable from pre lockdown times, all whilst ensuring their clients “new normal” situations are recognised and can be met.\n \nAFRICA\n \nSouth Africa:\n \n• The pandemic is seeing countries in Africa going into various versions of “lockdown”. The business community is striving to come to terms with the situation with the backdrop of little or in some countries no assistance.\n• Although Africa has not seen as many cases primarily due to their being less travel spreading the pandemic. However, there are notable clusters emerging.\n \nASIA\n \nAustralia:\n \n• Australia has experienced a move to “Big Government” during the pandemic with Government setting the agenda. We have seen over the last ten days the focus of Government shift from containment and suppression of the virus to rebooting the economy. It is expected to be a long process and with some staggered results. There is a concern that delay continues to set back the potential economic improvement.\n• The various regions of Australia have different restrictions, activity and requirements that are challenging the resumption of commercial activity and the restart of tourism. There is a strong desire by the Governments of Australia and New Zealand to open a “Bubble” of cross border travel sooner rather than later and this prospect becomes more realistic week by week. Other international travel looks to be delayed probably much longer.\n• Equities markets are showing positive signs of recovery already. International trade is recovering even with setbacks and tariffs being implemented in a new international protectionist climate. The large Government financial stimulus to the Australian economy is having a material impact boosting recovery prospect.\n \nIndia\n \n• Government of India has announced an economic package of INR 20 lakh crore (~$265 billion) including those announced earlier which accounts for 10% of India’s GDP.\n• This package brough in some relief for MSME (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) by infusing collateral-free automatic loans, subordinate debt for stressed MSMEs, equity infusion for MSMEs through a \"Fund of Funds\", and Rapid clearance of dues of MSMEs by Government of India.\n• GOI also made some tax reforms to maintain liquidity.\n \nSingapore\n \n• As Singapore emerges from its Circuit Breaker and enters Phase 1 Re-opening in June, the resumption of work is expected to go back up to 75% for various sectors such as Finance and Construction.\n• However, not all of it is positive news as business cessation could see an “uptick” in the coming months as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to put a severe strain on the Singapore economy.\n• The coronavirus pandemic is set to weigh on many sectors in the economy for the rest of the year. This includes outward-oriented sectors such as wholesale trade, air transport and tourism sectors, retail and food services.\n• On the other hand, sectors such as biomedical manufacturing, and information and communications will continue to grow.\n• The Government has slashed the country’s growth estimates in quick succession over recent months and is now expecting the economy to contract between 4 and 7 per cent this year. This will have repercussions for the job market.\n• The Government is implementing SG United Jobs and Skills Package that aims to support close to 100,000 jobseekers. The Package will include schemes to expand job opportunities in both the public and private sectors.\n• It will also provide a range of traineeships for jobseekers to gain industry-relevant experience and build up professional networks, while providing skill-upgrading opportunities.\n \nNew Zealand\n \n• A fortnight with zero new COVID cases, and just a solitary active case, gives obvious grounds for optimism. So does the gradual easing of previous restrictions including the move to allow gatherings of up to 100 people (up from 10 previously). It is highly anticipated that New Zealand will move to Alert Level 1 at some stage this week, which will mean business is back to the new normal with the exception that our border will remain closed. There is a possibility that the border may be opened to Australia and possibly some Pacific Island countries in due course but that is still some time away.\n• With the recent movement down alert levels, and with restrictions beings relaxed, it is no surprise to see many timely indicators showing marked improvement. From large jumps in domestic accommodation bookings (faster than the rest of the world according to Airbnb data) to retailers reporting a strong pickup in sales since the move to alert level 2 on 14 May.\n• There has been a massive policy support coursing through the system at present. This includes the exceptionally large wage subsidy programme that is supporting jobs and activity. The wage subsidy policy is being extended out to September, but with narrower conditions. Meanwhile, last week the Government announced that it will make temporary tax-free payments to workers who lost jobs because of the pandemic. Economic activity levels ahead will be influenced by such changes in policy support as well as the reopening of the economy.\n \nEUROPE\n \nThe EU region has seen a remarkable recovery in the past few weeks. The Governments have reopened borders with neighbouring countries and regionally THE business life is returning in stages with positive results. There are even plans from the EU to reopen the Schengen “borderless” system for their 26 participating countries.\n \nFrance\n \n• Bruno Le Maire, Minister of the Economy and Finance, announced a support plan for French start-ups. The State is going to release 1.2 billion euros between now and 2021, in addition to the first aid programme for French Tech of 4 billion euros announced in March.\n• The focus is on preventing the takeover of French startups by digital giants. This new support plan has two objectives. First, \"to guarantee our technological sovereignty. As we emerge from the crisis, we cannot afford for innovative French companies to be taken over by digital giants or foreign funds. There are approximately 13,000 start-ups in France, employing more than 100,000 people. In detail, a \"French Tech Sovereignty\" fund will be created. Managed by Bpifrance, it will be endowed with 150 million euros to finance companies developing \"future technologies of a sovereign nature\". The fund could then reach 500 million euros by 2021 \"according to need\".\n• After eight weeks of mandatory closure due to the pandemic, almost all non-food businesses have been allowed to receive customers since May 11. The results of the three weeks of phase 1 of the deconfinement are rather encouraging. While store traffic is certainly lower than in the same period in 2019, the decline is much less than the distribution professionals feared. In most outlets, the proportion of visitors who actually buy is well above the average observed before containment, and those who buy spend more. As a result, some stores have seen an increase in turnover in the last three weeks compared to the same period last year. And this, without having to multiply promotions. Stimulated by the good weather and the good news on the health front, French consumers seem to be increasingly enthusiastic about consuming. Children's fashion, toys, household equipment and sports have clearly recovered, while clothing, already in crisis before the confinement, remains in trouble. Despite this good news, the financial situation of many businesses remains precarious.\n• Economy Minister announced that the recession would be deeper than expected this year, with a decline in activity of 11% against -8% expected in mid-April. The State deficit will reach €220 billion, that of the Social Security 52.2 billion. The Government expects a debt close to 120% of GDP by the end of 2020. While these prospects are bleak, the Government does not intend to review its economic course. \"The Government's policy can be summed up in three words: it is a supply-side policy,\" Bruno Le Maire told the National Assembly. He had promised \"a recovery plan to modernize our production tool\". Behind the scenes, both the Minister of Economy and Emmanuel Macron have been more concerned in recent weeks by a decline in competitiveness vis-à-vis the rest of the euro zone than by the level of French debt. It is estimated that the situation of the French economy at the end of 2019 (growth revised upwards to +1.5%, a record level of foreign investment) is pushing to deepen the policy pursued since 2017. Economy Minister should therefore continue to push for a reduction in production taxes as a part of the recovery plan.\n \nGermany\n \n• Due to the existing visa restrictions business with the US is partly limited and effecting certain people/companies who need to travel to the US.\n• The construction industry is doing quite well compared to several other industries; hospitality and tourism are most effected by Covid-19.\n• The chamber of commerce expects a recovery of most industries in the coming months; with a new normal in 2020 or 2021, depending on the industry.\n• A positive outcome of the 130 billion Euro stimulus package is its focus on consumer spending. That may work! The issue of unemployment has reached about 3 million people plus 3 million still under employed ones plus 7 million under short-term working that may result in unemployment as well. Some consumers therefore may try to save money instead of spending it. Experts have already communicated that the effect for communities and small companies shall be positive. There are 50 million Euros included in the times package for future technologies, developments and ventures which is target oriented.\n• In Private Equity, the capital is on hold; some of it has been retrieved out of funds to wait for good opportunities. In Real Estate Logistics & Infrastructure, most Office and Residential investments should perform relatively positive. Banking face strong demand on workload in restructuring the loans to corporates and are putting their focus on cost cutting. In Consulting business some face short-time work. If not, switching is possible to more demand on tasks in regulatory and risk, operations improvement, digitalization, infrastructure or FMCG internet and marketing topics.\n \nRussia\n \n• More companies in Russia are working in offices again but most international companies plan to stay on distance work until September or even until end of this year.\n• Some companies’ business volumes are increasing again, and managers are a little more positive.\n• Restrictions in Russia are being eased, starting with Moscow where non-food shops and some of the service sector companies can re-open.\n• Major factories in Russia re-started in May and this week the IKEA stores and Manufacturing reopened in Moscow.\n• We are seeing business confidence return , new Sales management and purchasing management projects have started in Estonia, Latvia and in Tatarstan, Russia in the metal and oil/gas sectors.\n \nUK\n \n• UK has implemented a recovery programme. Phase one has seen construction, garden centres and manufacturing return to work. Some school age groups return to school depending on social distancing. Phase two will see small shops and services reopen on 15th June and phase three will see restaurants, bars, gyms and all other businesses return from July 4th.\n• Major sectors such as hospitality are seeing businesses not reopening. The airline industry is restarting but the Government 14 day “self-Isolation” scheme on entering the UK will severely restrict the travel industry’s prospects to relaunch.\n• A “Business Bounce Back” loan scheme has been released giving SMEs the ability to borrow up to £50,000 at 2.5% interest (repayments to start in 2021), the loans are 100% Government backed.\n• Recruitment sector has returned. Many projects that were “stopped” earlier have now been reactivated. Some businesses are starting to reassess their growth strategies as now they can see and evaluate how the business has survived in the lockdown period.\n \nAMERICAS\n \nLatin America is the latest centre for the pandemic. North America is seeing signs of recovery and returning to normal.\n \nBrazil\n \n• Is now onto its fourth month of the pandemic situation. Cases are still concentrated in the Southeast region – states of São Paulo, Rio, and in the North and Northeast areas – states of Amazonas, Ceará and Pernambuco. It seems that Brazil is approaching its critical point of the curve in June. The State of São Paulo has prorogated current lockdown to June 30 and the City of São Paulo extended its municipal lockdown till June 15th.\n• Brazilian GDP has drop by 1.5% in the first quarter of 2020. According to specialists, for total 2020 this indicator may reach from 7.0% to 9.0%.\n• Effective June 01, the Government of São Paulo State has instituted a plan with strategic action to start the recovery of the businesses under a technical, safe, but gradual form, based on a periodic evaluation of the various (about 10) pre-determined individual regions’ pandemic conditions. Due to its large size, the City of São Paulo will be considered as an independent region, taking into account its self-sufficiency and structural health condition.\n• Technical Criteria – there are two criteria in order to calculate the risk phase and the fitting of each region: “Capacity of Response of (respective) Health System” and a second one: “Evolution of the Pandemic”. The first one, “Capacity of Response of Health System” is based on the following indicators: (1) Covid-19 - Occupation Hospital Bed Rate; and (2) Available Amount of Hospital Beds destined to the intensive care of Covid-19 patients per 100 thousand inhabitants. The criterion “Evolution of the Pandemic” is composed by the following indicators: (1) Contamination Rate; (2) Internment Rate; and (3) Cases of Deaths.\n• Recovery flexibility authorization will follow the phase procedure: Red Phase: only essential activities, according to a published list, can stay open. Orange Phase: in addition to the previous phase: shopping centers (without food service activity), street commerce shops and services shops, but limited to 20% of working capacity, business periods reduced to 4 consecutive hours. (activities not allowed to function bars, restaurants for local services, beauty shops, barber shops, sports academies). Yellow Phase: shopping centers (except for local food services), street commerce and services shops may function with limitation to 40% of working time; working hours reduced to 6 consecutive hours and adoption of standard protocols and specific sectorial ones. Beauty shops, barber shops, bars and restaurants are allowed to function only in outside areas. Green Phase: All commerce and services activities, including gyms and shopping centers food services limited to 60% of working time and adoption of standard and sectorial protocols. Events generating social agglomeration are not allowed to function. Blue Phase: Normal economy recovery activities under the “new normal”.\n \nUSA and Canada\n \n• North American markets have been very measured during the last 90 days, i.e. since the covid19 disruptions and lockdowns have been in place. Several phenomena are noticeable.\n• Current executive search and consulting assignments are moving slower as our clients are being very measured about adding to staff and team availability to participate in consulting efforts has been limited. New roles are being actively considered but timing for hiring is still reasonably uncertain. Action oriented consulting on new markets and new approaches to market are moving at a sub-optimal pace.\n• Some of our clients appear to be using the current environment to release their less successful employees and are being incredibly careful to avoid legal risk with re-alignment of functions.\n• Opportunities to revise organizational design and realign functions are being hampered by the lack of certainty.\n• The recent and continuing racial discord is distracting as corporations and faith communities are taking center stage rather than leadership from national or in some cases, state officials.\n• Curfews and “stay at home “ orders are still in places in some areas causing significant distractions.\n• The news of this week about an increased rate of new covid19 cases is not surprising as the lifting of “lock downs” is now elapsed over 14 days.\n• Cautious optimism is just beneath the surface, but the unnecessary distractions have to be mitigated.\nWe hope that you, your family, and work colleagues continue to stay healthy and safe. We at The Taplow Group are here to support you and your company through this crisis and beyond. We will be back with more updates soon!\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3569)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "Leading Across the Generations by Barbara Liebermeister, Founder and Managing Director of the IFIDZ, Germany\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nSunday, June 7, 2020\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 3.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWith an increasing number of generations working together in organizations, it has become important for leaders to adapt their \n leadership styles\n to be able to build trust and communicate with employees in the best possible way to boost understanding, motivation and results.\n \nFor example, with people preferring to work more years and retiring much later in life, the age of the workforce of a company can sometimes span up to 50 years. As a result, five generations may need to collaborate within one organization.\n \nSo how does one lead effectively across generations?\n \nAs per sociologist’s definitions, there are the \ntraditionalists\n (born before 1950) who are more or less at the helm of affairs in most organizations, whilst the older of the \nbaby boomers\n (born 1951 to 1964), have already reached or are close to the retirement age.\n \nThen there’s Generation X (1965 to 1980), who is handling medium to senior executive roles, and Generation Y (1981 to 2000), whose members have already worked their way up into established top performer positions. And, last but not the least, Generation Z (from 2001), which is often found in apprenticeship and training roles.\n \nThis increasing age gap not only leads to friction due to differing life situations and quantum of experience but it also has a significant impact on leadership. This is because each generation has their own preferred way of being led. The old pecking order of “The boss is older than his staff“ no longer applies. Today, leaders face the challenge of having to lead not only much younger, but also older members of staff. This makes leadership even more challenging as there are not just age-related differences in what each individual needs, but also in the way they approach their tasks and respond.\n \nAnd adding to this mix is the complexity of Digital Natives versus Digital Immigrants.\nDigital Natives are those young employees born after 1990 and have grown up with digital technologies. Leaders often find it challenging to lead this group with each individual just doing his or her own thing.\n \nOn the other side, there are the so-called Digital Immigrants who are born before 1990, which is much before the computers and smartphone launched the victory march of digital technologies. This group had to learn the ropes of these technologies at an adult age  and therefore they are often still insecure or even anxious while dealing with technology.\n \nIt is often suggested that Digital Natives, in contrast to Digital Immigrants, put much greater emphasis on self-fulfilment than on developing their career. This might apply to some Digital Natives – but maybe, these are simply younger than their colleagues and hence don’t (yet) feel the pressure of having to provide for a family.\n \nBut no matter which generation or what level of technology know-how is involved, to overcome the challenges that stem from different ways of thinking and working, everybody involved needs to display a willingness for mutual understanding. This understanding needs to be promoted. An organization should focus on providing opportunities for the employees to get to know each other better across generations – for example through something as simple as a department wise coffee meet.\n \nIf there’s mutual understanding, the strengths attributed to the individual “generations” can be leveraged in a targeted manner. Doing so will help in building trust and opening the communication channels, helping performance and results rise.\n \nFor example the technical know-how of generation Y, the desire to make a difference of generation X, and the serenity resulting from the experience of the baby boomers, can all compliment each other and propel an organization towards success.\n \nThus the diversity in age will transform into a benefit for the company, and for every individual employee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (4679)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "Why Human Capital Development Is Essential For Organizations?\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nTuesday, May 26, 2020\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHuman Capital refers to the economic value added to a firm by the knowledge, innovation, skills, expertise, and creativity of its employees. Human Capital Development is critical to the profits and productivity of an organization. They are valuable assets that are not recorded in the balance sheets but can give sustainable competitive advantages in this VUCA (vulnerability, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) world. Hence, in this knowledge-based world, employees are the most critical assets. Investing in \nhuman capital development\n is investing time and money in hiring, training, personality development, career planning, and upgrading skills and competencies.\n \nHuman capital is the most complicated resource in this knowledge-based economy. Companies must invest in human capital development. The benefits of such investment can be highlighted as – \n \n \nEmployee Satisfaction\n – Investing in human capital will increase employee satisfaction. Once employees feel that the organization cares and values their learning and development, their productivity will increase automatically. \n \n \n \nRetention Rates\n – If you invest in an employee's career development, then he/she does not need to look for a better opportunity. Employees who receive career advancement opportunities within an organization will not look outside for the same. This means higher retention rates and efficiency.\n \n \n \nEmployee Engagement\n – Highly engaged employees are more productive and loyal to their organizations. Investing in human capital development would increase employee engagement. Find out the aspirations and career goals of your employees and then align programs according to them.\n \n \n \nCommunication\n - Human capital development improves every aspect of employee performance. It will create new channels of communication and refine existing communication routes. Increased employee engagement upgrades, both vertical and horizontal communication channels.\n \n \n \nRecruitment\n – Talented people and skills employees will always love to join organizations that invest heavily in human capital development. This will give your firm an extra edge during the human capital search.\n \n \n \nCompany Culture\n – Investing in human capital will enhance the organization's culture. Employee satisfaction, engagement, and communication are directly correlated with a positive culture. This increases employee productivity and, ultimately, your bottom line.\n \n \nBut finding the best human capital resources in today's modern economy is a daunting task. With reduced unemployment rates, it is not easy to find the right fit. Today it is not only technical expertise but also about cultural fits. Hence, you must avail human capital search services and leave the rest onto the experts. This is also an essential part of human capital development.\n \nIf you invest in human capital search, then you get connected to the best talents across the world. The human capital search consultants know your business, understand the industry, and have years of experience in hiring the best talents. Your organization is as good as your employees. Making a small mistake in the hiring of executives could come at a high cost. managers of C-suite employees will cost you dearly. Many organizations collapse because they never invested in human capital development. \n \nThe success of any organization depends on how its human capital manages the financial capital. No doubt, in this knowledge-based economy, investing in human capital development is probably the best investment.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (6317)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "Best Tools For A Work From Home Executive Search Consultant\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nThursday, May 21, 2020\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe year 2020 would be remembered for a long time in history. Not because space tourism became a daily activity or Marvel came up with another superhit movie, but for the global pandemic, which has affected millions of lives. Currently, it is the biggest threat that humankind has ever faced. But, like the UN Secretary-General António Guterres, we also believe that together we can fight and protect humanity against COVID19.\n \nDue to the outbreak, almost all the organizations have switched to the remote working model. \n Even executive search consultants\n have adopted this new way of working. Executive search differs from the regular recruitment process. The former is about hiring C-suite candidates and connecting them with their potential employers. CXOs or senior managers have the responsibility of driving an organization, its growth, expansion, and sustainability. Thus, the job of an executive search consultant comes with a lot of responsibility. The executive search process involves studying an organization’s culture, their business process, the roles and responsibilities of the vacant position, and then matching it to the right candidate.\n \nWorking from home might be overwhelming for many, especially executive recruitment consultants. The job involves a lot of face-to-face interactions for the best executive search. It takes time to understand whether a candidate is technically and culturally fit for an organization. But technology has simplified many things for executive search consultants. Now one can connect with anyone from across the globe. There are no physical boundaries, overhead investments, or time constraints to limit the executive search. With the help of technology and its tools, executive search consultants can perform any job sitting right out of their homes. \n \nWorking from home brings in many advantages. Just like an artist needs the perfect set of paints and brushes to create an artwork, an executive search consultant also needs the best tools to remain productive.\n \n \nCommunication Tool\n – The first tool that is needed for executive search is an excellent quality software for video and audio communication. The success of candidate interviews and client presentations is largely dependent on video communication software in a remote setting.\n \nProject Management Software\n – This will help organize work, keep track of progress, and make it easy for executive recruitment consultants to work from home.\n \nCloud Storage\n – An executive search consultant has a massive database of candidates across the globe, multiple documents and presentations as well. This data needs to be secured and stored across a cloud platform. It will enable a search consultant to access it from anywhere, anytime.\n \nTeam Collaboration Tool\n– Though we maintain social distancing, yet technology can connect us. These tools will connect teams across different locations for daily meetings and updates.\n \nOther Software \n- These would include the tools for note taking, maintaining work-life balance, and engaging with fellow employees.\n \n \nAlmost all companies engaged in Executive Search have adopted the remote working model. We believe that the global pandemic has changed the work environment for good. Video conferences would replace live interviews. Online tools and software will become critical in judging the fitment of a candidate. But whatever be the scenario, an executive search consultant will never stop working. The executive search for the best candidate will continue with the help of online tools and software.\n \nAt The Taplow Group we have taken all the necessary steps for business continuity and we are serving our clients globally through our work from home model across our offices around the world.

This is the fourth in our ‘Biweekly Business Updates’ from our partners around the world. The situation is showing clear signs of recovery although it is still characterized by nuances that exist in every country and region.  \n \nAFRICA:\n \nSouth Africa:\n \n \nThe pandemic is seeing countries in Africa going into various versions of “lockdown”. The business community is striving to come to terms with the situation with the backdrop of little or in some countries no assistance.\n \n \n \nAfrica has not seen as many cases primarily due to there being less travel spreading the pandemic, still notable clusters are emerging.\n \n \nASIA: \n \nAustralia:\n \nAustralia has done an amazing job of flattening the curve, and we have seen encouraging results and the easing of some government restrictions. Early moves to wind back the restrictions in Australia started this week. What we have seen so far includes:\n \n \nMassive government stimulus both fiscal and monetary to individuals and organisations.\n \n \nEarly signs of staged reopening with different regions of Australia opening up more than others.\n \n \nVaccine and treatment trials to be funded by government and private organisations.\n \n \nA restriction on activity and closure of shop front retail has driven a surge in ecommerce with ‘Australia Post’ experiencing high volumes of parcels for delivery.\n \n \nCurrent processing volumes are close to two million parcels a day and are exceeding the busiest Christmas period. \n \n \nSome travel may return soon with Qantas flying a small number of international, domestic, and regional services for essential travel.\n \n \nAustralian domestic and trans-Tasman flights have been cancelled till the end of June 2020 and with the exception of perhaps New Zealand, international travel restrictions are likely to remain in place to the end of July 2020.\n \n \nIndia:\n \n \nGovernment of India has announced an economic package of INR 20 lakh crore (~$265 billion) including those announced earlier which accounts for 10% of India’s GDP.\n \n \nThis package has brought in some relief for MSME (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) by infusing collateral-free automatic loans, subordinate debt for stressed MSMEs, equity infusion for MSMEs through a \"Fund of Funds\", and rapid clearance of dues of MSMEs by Government of India\n \n \nGOI has also made some tax reforms to maintain liquidity\n \n \nThere is some relief for migrant workers, small farmers, small business owners, and those who are self-employed as the GOI is providing them with loans at concessional rates, credit moratorium, interest subvention, liquidity support, and new credit cards sanctions\n \n \nIn a strategy to attract FDI, particularly foreign firms wanting to move out of China, to boost investment., the Indian government is reportedly in the process of identifying and developing 4.6 lakh hectares of land, including 1.1 lakh hectares of existing land in industrial areas, and planning fiscal incentives in the form of preferential tax rates, tax holidays etc in order to attract foreign firms\n \n \nWith the median age of 27 and around 900 million “working-age” population, India is a young and aspirational economy.\n \n \nGOI has also announced some policy reforms to fast-track investment which is an effort towards a self-dependent India\n \n \nIncentive schemes for promotion of new champion sectors will be launched in sectors such as solar PV manufacturing; advanced cell battery storage; etc.\n \n \nUpgradation of industrial infrastructure along with availability of industrial land/ land bank for promoting new investments and making information available on industrial information system (IIS) with GIS mapping is also proposed.\n \n \nCommercial mining has also been introduced in coal sector by introducing competition, transparency and private sector participation in the coal sector through revenue sharing mechanism instead of regime of fixed rupee/tonne, liberalizing the entry norms, and investment of Rs 50,000 crores for incentivising coal gasification / liquefication and infrastructure development is on the cards.\n \n \nThere would also be enhancement of private investments in the mineral sector through structural reforms to boost growth, employment and bringing in of state-of-the-art technology, especially in exploration.\n \n \nEnhancing self reliance in defence production, reduction in flying cost Rs. 1000 crores for efficient airspace management for civil aviation, more world-class airports through PPP, and boosting private sector investment in social infrastructure through revamped viability gap funding scheme are some other concrete steps taken by GOI.\n \n \n \nSingapore:\n \n \nConstruction contractors that have met the COVID-19 safety measures for the construction sector announced by the Singapore Government on Friday (May 15) can begin work on their projects. \n \n \nThis is in addition to the plan to let critical and time-sensitive projects such as train works and sewerage system tunnelling projects to begin first when the “circuit breaker” is lifted, as well as activities that cannot be left idle for too long due to safety concerns. \n \n \nFor the remaining sectors, gradual safe re-opening of workplaces is to start on 2nd June with employers having to implement safe management measures.\n \n \n \nNew Zealand:\n \n \nThe good news is that since 11.59pm on Wednesday 13\nth\n May, alert level 2 has been implemented. This is due to the number of new Covid-19 cases reducing significantly to a point where most new cases (for several days lately there have been no new cases reported) are linked to known clusters.  Moving to alert level 2 means that much of the economy will open including restaurants, malls, cinemas, shops, health services, and hairdressers. People will be able to socialise with others and travel around the country, as well as playing team professional sports (be it in empty stadiums). Schools and early childhood centres will open from 18\nth\n May 2020. Finally, on 21\nst\n May 2020 will be allowed to reopen. \n \n \nThis week the New Zealand Government announced $50 billion of new spending. This is in addition to the $12.1 billion delivered on March 17. Cumulatively, this amounts to a staggering 20% of GDP.  $20 billion of the $50 billion touted still lies unallocated. This gives the government time to see how the crisis evolves before making its next move. Targeted extension of the wage subsidy scheme, the creation of thousands of environment-improving jobs, a decision to build an extra 8,000 state houses and a massive injection into the health sector are some of the key aspects of the new spending.\n \n \nLike most of New Zealand’s economic indicators for April, job advertising fell dramatically. This month can be termed as the most impacted month by the nation’s maximum-level economic and social lockdown. This level 4 lasted from 26 March to 27 April, after which level 3 came back into play. The 65.3% drop in job advertising in April, followed a 27.0% fall in March, makes for an annual decline rate of 75.4%.\n \n \nEUROPE:\n \nThe region has suffered in unequal parts over the last few weeks. A flattening of the curve of infections is starting to show with many countries starting to move out of “lockdown” periods and allowing business to open again.\n \nFrance:\n \n \nBanks have confirmed their support for the French economy. Launched on March 25, the loan guaranteed by the State (PGE) is quite popular with companies and professionals. After a month and a half, there are more than 500,000 applications for almost €100 billion, from companies and professionals whose economic activity has been impacted by the coronavirus outbreak and the lockdown period.\n \n \nThe banks along with the Government support, put the PGE in place in record time, in order to provide the necessary cash flow for the territory's businesses and activities (professionals, companies of all sizes).\n \n \nEuropean economic figures for the first quarter show that France is suffering more than its neighbours from the health crisis. From January to March, economic activity fell by 5.8%, compared with 5.2% in Spain, 4.7% in Italy and around 2% in Germany. According to Brussels' forecasts, over the whole year, France's economic contraction should exceed 8%. This slippage is due to the particularly strict containment conditions imposed by the Government.\n \n \nThe imprecise directives on the health conditions for the resumption of activity have slowed down the recovery of businesses, as has the very generous short time working scheme set up by the Government. France has just begun to unlock on May 11\nth\n with a first assessment on the last week of May for checking if there is a decrease in COVID cases. Then, on the 2d of June, a second phase will begin with the reopening of tourist activities such as restaurants and hotels.\n \n \n \nFinland\n:\n \n \nWhat we can immediately see in our customer base and read in the news is that recruitment is mostly on hold for big companies, especially when it comes to manager-level assignments. In C-level, the situation has not really changed as CEO´s and CFO´s still need to be replaced, perhaps even more in these circumstances.\n \n \nMany industrial companies working in global markets, report that particularly in Asia and China, the demand is the same as before the crisis.\n \n \nAlso, in Finland the government is extending full support and funding for suffering companies. A huge amount of money is being spent, and we are waiting to see the results.\n \n \nMany of the services will be opened soon and in the hospitality sector as well. Also some travelling between neighboring countries also could happen now, so we can easily assume that we are gradually coming out of the lockdown period.\n \n \n \n \nGermany:\n \n \nDue to low infection and death rate, hospitals are not over crowded. Schools are also opening again\n \n \nBorders to our neighboring countries are being opened and border control should end by June 15th\n \n \nBusinesses (smaller shops,) are opening, and we expect that our economy will go back to work in 2nd and 3rd quarter\n \n \nDue to on going rules like distancing, masks etc. we do not expect that our economy will fully recover this year.\n \n \n \n \nUK\n:\n \n \nThe UK has implemented a recovery programme. Phase one has seen construction, garden centres and manufacturing return to work. Phase two will see small shops and some school children return to school depending on social distancing. Phase three will see restaurants, bars, gyms and all other businesses return.\n \n \nThe government has extended the furlough scheme until October 2020; therefore employers can bring staff back in a structured manner\n \n \nA “Business Bounce Back” loan scheme has been released giving SMEs the ability to borrow up to £50,000 at 2.5% interest (repayments to start in 2021), the loans are 100% government backed\n \n \nThe coming month will be critical in regard to how quickly the UK Economy starts functioning again.\n \n \nAMERICAS:\n \nThe Americas are fast becoming the new epicentre of the pandemic.\n \nBrazil\n:\n \n \nTwo and half months after the first cases of the pandemic, Brazil is currently the fourth country worldwide in terms of infected citizens. It has reported 223 thousand cases including15.6 thousand deaths. Lockdown and other pertinent decisions rest with each state. In the State of São Paulo, current lockdown term expires on May 31\nst\n. A new prorogation is likely to be instituted due to the fact we did not reach our pandemic peak yet\n \n \n2020 Brazilian GDP is currently estimated to be -7% or more. US$ rate previously quoted at R$ 4.03 on 12/1019, now peaked at R$ 5.82. Government is designing a plan to help state and municipality finances, mainly to cover public worker’s payrolls. Banks are being asked to provide emergency credit lines to the private sector\n \n \nThe government is beginning to pay the second of three monthly installments of the “Emergency Allowance” pay of R$ 600,00 (US$ 103.00) to 60 million small entrepreneurs and informal workers not covered by Social Security, government social assistance program (Bolsa Família) or by the Brazilian Labor Laws.\n \n \nDue to the reduction in oil prices and the pandemic situation restrictions, Petrobras, our oil state owned company was hit by a US$ 10 billion loss in the first quarter of 2020.\n \n \nThe São Paulo State Government (30%+ of Brazilian GDP) has started to design a “post-pandemic recovery plan” for the state economy, involving representatives of all economic sectors, like: agricultural/agribusiness, general industry, services, banking, private economic experts, representatives from the university institutions, and social leaders.\n \n \n \n \nUSA and Canada:\n \n \nAll but the most marginal US businesses are adjusting to the new normal of dealing with the Corvid 19 pandemic.  Some, particularly capital-intensive businesses such as airlines, as well major medical facilities will have to be both creative and will have to rely on government aid to make it through this time. \n \n \nPharma (Life Sciences), Tech and communications services providers seemingly will do well.  New industries such as “just in time” home delivery business models will fill in with many new jobs.  Entrepreneurs will tighten their belt and adjust their business to this transient state.\n \n \nThe US economy has suffered the most severe setback ever seen during our current working lifetime.  Approximately 18,000,000 US workers will have applied for unemployment benefits in the last 4 weeks and over 2 million small businesses have applied for some form of financial relief. Response times are slow and according to some news media, we have already fully used the relief funds approved by our Congress and signed by our President.\n \n \nKey Finding:\n \n \nCompanies \nare finalizing their exit from enforced lockdown across the globe\n \n \nExecutives\n are dealing with the nuances of getting back to work, with a workforce that is uncertain of the future; leadership skills are being tested across every sector\n \n \nCompanies\n are reassessing their working practices, in the cessation of lockdown, new ways of producing products, servicing clients need to be quickly identified and actioned\n \n \n \nWe hope that you, your family, and work colleagues continue to stay healthy and safe, we at Taplow are here to support you and your company through this crisis and we will be back with updated news soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3334)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "The 12 Steps for UK Hospitality to Bounce Back Beyond the Coronavirus Outbreak by Mark McMullen\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nThursday, May 14, 2020\n/\nCategories: \nNews\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUK hospitality businesses are likely to be currently focussing on how to deal with the effects of the coronavirus outbreak, but now is also the time forward thinking business leaders should be looking beyond – to their plans for recovery. There is little doubt that the coronavirus presents a significant challenge for the entire world. The numbers are staggering, and the news updates overwhelming so it’s little wonder that global markets have been rocked and senior business leaders are treating this as their new highest priority.\n\n\nIt is only right that everyone’s primary concern is with preservation of life and it is encouraging that early scientific and anecdotal evidence is that the huge majority of those infected will make a full recovery in a relatively short space of time. However, the number of confirmed UK cases has just passed 100, and sadly one woman in her 70's, who tested positive and believed to previously in ill health, has died. Despite there\n\n\nbeing around 17,000 flu related deaths in the UK each year it’s easy to see that it is fear rather than purely facts and numbers that can have such a significant impact on the way we live day to day and on how businesses perform. I have worked in consumer industries such as hospitality and retail for over 25 years and experienced periods of severe disruption from “natural causes” like this in the past. In 2001 Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) had far-reaching impacts beyond farming and food e.g. it is estimated that our tourism industry suffered a £3bn impact in that year with a similar cost to our public sector.\n\n\n\n\nPost the 2001 FMD outbreak impacted businesses struggled to adapt quickly enough to a new world of changed consumer habits and so prolonged their losses. \n\n\nOf course, there are differences regarding the coronavirus, however, 2001 FMD is proof that widespread fear in humans will drive widespread changes in their behaviours. Some of free will; some forced upon them and not all conducive to the on-going success or even survival of many business sectors. We have every reason to be confident, not complacent, that this virus will be controlled, and normal service may then resume. As hospitality business leaders are likely to already have “disaster management” plans to deal with the outbreak I would like to urge those same leaders to start planning now on how to return to thriving profits post the outbreak as I believe the UK hospitality sector will see significant growth post this awful period but it won’t be easy and senior leaders will need to be ready in order to capitalise.\n\n\n1. Trust Your People:\n\n\nYour culture is already built on trust and you can prove that your leaders at each level have trusted relationships with their teams so you have good reason to be confident that your team managers will make the right decisions and show the right behaviours. You may have given additional support and training to managers during the outbreak period. That will certainly help.\n\n\nHowever, when the end of the outbreak arrives many employees may still be infected, afraid to return to work or have concerns. It is critically important that all managers continue with the great work they did during the outbreak period and show empathy and understanding. Not all employees will feel able to return to work at the same point even if the circumstances appear the same so ensure all managers are acting consistently and showing trust.\n\n\n2. Continue with Additional Support for Your People:\n\n\nDisaster management or avoidance is a likely approach during the outbreak period and many of your staff will show great flexibility, loyalty, and grit during that time. If this period has resulted in a downturn in revenues, then many of your employees are likely to have suffered lower incomes as overtime becomes scarce or they have been off sick, whether unwell or in isolation. The value of their tips is likely to be much lower too and, dependent upon the circumstances at their children’s school, their child-care costs may have risen. Many may have taken short-term loans to an end during the lean period.\n\n\nLet your people know that help is available. If you offer interest free employee loans include reminders in your communications, guide managers on how to support locally and with tact by encouraging each team member to support each other – some will be happy to give up shifts whilst others will feel desperate for the extra hours.\n\n\n\r\nRemind all employees of your helplines and if you don’t have one now would be a good time to set one up.\n\n\n3. Welcome Back Your People:\n\n\nOnce the peak of disruption and fear is over and most of your teams are back in work then, with tact and decorum, celebrate! Encourage leaders to act with freedom within a framework as they have always done and do something locally that shows appreciation for what their team have been through. Also, take time now to prepare how the board will thank everyone. If your style is a letter, then draft it now so you can focus on maximum revenues and profit when the upturn come.\n\n\n4. Maintain Increased Communications:\n\n\nNo doubt your outbreak plan will have included increasing communications with all team members. Maintain these for at least 3 months following the end of this period.\n\n\nNot everyone (employees and customers) will return to normality at the same rate so keeping all of your team members well informed with a support network to have their questions and concerns answered will make a big difference to the speed at which they return to their best.\n\n\n5. Evaluate the Future of Flexible Working:\n\n\nWhilst only applicable to a limited number of roles it is likely that whatever your starting point, your business saw a greater uptake of working from home during the outbreak period. This may well have brought newfound improvements in efficiency, productivity, and morale that you wish to see continue. Do not assume that all those who switched to flexible working temporarily wish to revert to previous ways but do appropriately investigate what is right for your people and your business going forward. Whatever approaches you decide to adopt, be clear with your people and welcome their queries.\n\n\n6. Welcome Back Your Customers:\n\n\nIt is extremely likely that this virus outbreak will result in a downturn in customer numbers and although the level of opportunity this brings will depend on the impact on your people resource there are most definitely opportunities to capitalise on during quieter than expected times. Here are a few:\n\n\n• Improve your sites: When your customers return you have an opportunity to showcase your physical environments as the best, they have ever been\n\n\n• Address maintenance issues those where disruption to the customer experience is unavoidable\n\n\n• Focus available resource on cleaning and hygiene standards\n\n\n• Bring forward scheduled works such as equipment servicing and decoration\n\n\n• Consider bringing forward wholesale improvements such as I.T. or supply chain enhancements (these will need particularly careful planning taking available resource into consideration as well as financial impact)\n\n\n• Utilise chef resource to participate in future menu development ideas – no doubt already a scheduled part of your annual activities, However, there are great benefits from getting ready for future changes ahead of time\n\r\n• Prepare a catalogue of marketing activities suitable for encouraging customers to return so they may be deployed at a short notice later\n\n\n• Train your people: You are likely to have prioritised improving multi-skilling as part of your plan to mitigate the impact from absence at sites and once completed move on to areas of greatest benefit to customer service if trade is low.\n\n\nIf we experience a lengthy spell of consumers avoiding social spaces\n\n\nthen the popularity of our pubs, restaurants, hotels, and cafes\n\n\ncould take an unexpected and significant knock that will require\n\n\ngreat expertise from business leaders to overcome.\n\n\n7. Evaluate Any Long-Term Changes in Consumer Behaviours\n\n\nOne of the risks to periods of disruption is that, during these periods, our customers forge new habits and even the best welcome back plan may not be enough to compel some to return as they feel their new world is an improvement on the old one.\n\n\nThis may manifest in a number of ways e.g. if, despite your best efforts they have switched to a competitor then traditional methods of winning custom back are likely to be your choice of weapon e.g. targeted marketing, social media presence and focussing on what your brand stands for.\n\n\nHowever, if the consumer change is deeper than it is critical you are aware of it.\n\n\nFollowing the FMD in 2001 beef sales plummeted for several years and later, big changes in how the British meat industry guaranteed its quality were essential in order for consumer confidence to begin to return.\n\n\nThe difference here with the coronavirus is obvious, however, if we experience a lengthy spell of consumers avoiding social spaces then the popularity of our pubs, restaurants, hotels, and cafes could take an unexpected and significant knock that will require great expertise from business leaders to overcome.\n\r\nPotential changes in consumers may not be as obvious and simple as staying away from venues so my advice is to plan now for the gathering of high-quality insight at a local and national level. Spend time determining what questions you need answering and be prepared to adjust your long-term strategy on the back of your findings before your competitors do.\n\n\n8. Prepare for Revenues Higher Than Pre-Outbreak\n\n\nI believe more likely than customers staying away from our venues for lengthy periods following the outbreak we will experience an overall increase in customer numbers and, therefore, revenues. For 4 main reasons:\n\r\n1. You have done such a great job during the outbreak that you actually attracted new customers from less diligent and ill-prepared competitors. These new customers were impressed so are sticking with you!\n\n\n2. You mastered your welcome back plan and implemented it brilliantly so, again, you have attracted new customers\n\n\n3. Perhaps most significantly, international travel is already suffering, and it is highly likely more Brits than previous years will already be planning a “staycation” for summer 2020. Of course, there is a flip side in that those venues that usually benefit from overseas visitors are likely to see a downturn. However, history tells us that more Brits holidaying on home soil is good for our hospitality business overall.\n\n\n4. Even if the virus is brought under control in China relatively quickly retailers will still need to brace for an impact e.g. with apparel businesses relying so heavily on Chinese manufacturing they are expected to be one of the worst effected and slowest to recover. Primark have already stated that their summer ranges and stock levels will suffer in the UK no matter how quickly the recovery now comes. This scenario brings an opportunity for the UK hospitality sector, as whilst the retail sector is still recovering consumers will have spare spending power, as clothing retailers are unable to service their desires.\n\n\nMy advice is to prepare for an overall increase in revenues versus pre-outbreak but note: The impact this virus has on tourism and the knock-on effects to other sectors are likely to be amongst the most volatile and changeable so an area that hospitality business leaders should remain extremely close to. Data from travel analytics firm, Forward Keys, shows that international flights booked from the UK were down 20% year-on-year for the 5-week period ending February 23rd and likely to be much worse since then. The international tourist is a major customer to many hospitality businesses so we should expect an impact. However, many consumers place high importance on their holidays and won’t give them up easily so reliant businesses need to show great flexibility. Even if bookings remain strong, last minute cancellations are probable and conversely, if the outbreak period passes quickly, last minute bookings are also possible.\n\n\n9. CONTROL COSTS\n\n\nToo often “control costs” is interpreted as “reduce costs” but control is certainly the right word here.\n\n\nAnd the Key Message for Hospitality Business Leaders is Clarity, Clarity, Clarity!\n\n\nYou may have decided to reduce certain costs during the downturn of the outbreak period. A reduction in team meetings and travelling may have identified that on-going lower cost budgets are appropriate. Equally, you may have brought forward planned expenditure during the quieter trading patterns and must now negate the temporary overspend versus budget. Perhaps temporary cost reductions were essential, but you now wish for a return to usual spending as trade returns. Or maybe you have decided to invest in increased labour to capitalise on the increased customer numbers described in point 8.\n\r\nWhatever you decide is right for your business it is critical that you communicate clearly with all team members and monitor performance closely. You and your teams have potentially been through a huge turmoil by this stage and had to show great flexibility and nimble leadership to deliver a satisfactory commercial performance. KPI targets and budgets may have changed more than once so once the board has agreed the new expectations, even if they are simply a return to what used to be, make it ultra-clear for everyone.\n\n\n10. Forecast Carefully:\n\n\nRegular reviews are part of the DNA of any good hospitality business, however, the tip here is to avoid the trap of increasing year-end forecasts at the first sign of recovery. Continue with best, worst, and mid scenarios and resist the pressure from shareholders that is likely to be building by now. They will be looking for original, pre-outbreak forecasts to be met at year-end and diligent caution should be adopted particularly when viruses are known to return.\n\n\n11. Prepare for A 2nd Wave:\n\n\nProbably the last thing you want to hear, however, scientists have stated that even if the virus is controlled quickly and helped by rising summer temperatures a 2nd wave can arrive along with the return of colder weather. The great news, of course, is that you have mastered it once so you can do it even better a 2nd time! Most importantly, shortly after the 1\nst\n outbreak period performs a full review of how your business coped. Capture the successes and opportunities to develop a master plan you can deploy at a moment’s notice.\n\n\n12. Continue with Increased Risk Register Reviews:\n\n\nSimilar to some previous points around communications and forecasting continue with your increased attention to the risk register for at least 3 months following the outbreak period. There is no doubt you will have made changes during that period and hopefully some scary entries have now reduced in severity or gone altogether. You will need to be ultra-nimble and potentially strategically flexible for some time until the coronavirus threat goes completely. As the coronavirus has only just begun it is only natural to have concerns and I wish you, your family, your friends, and colleagues the absolute best of health. Let us not forget that scientists in the UK are extremely confident that most of us will not become infected and those who are will make a full and speedy recovery.\n\n\nPotentially, you are more concerned about the impact on your business and I wish you every success in your endeavours to overcome the challenges you are facing into.\n\n\nMark McMullen has extensive experience in senior leadership roles within hospitality, retail and leisure where being people centric has been key to his success.

Taplow partners across the globe have combined to give insights into how their countries/ markets are seeing the impact on business and the positives that are starting to shine through. \n \nAFRICA:\n \nAlthough Africa has not seen as many cases primarily due to their being less travel spreading the pandemic, notable clusters are emerging. \n \nSouth Africa: \nThe pandemic is seeing countries in Africa going into various versions of “lockdown”. The business community is striving to come to terms with the situation with the backdrop of little or in some countries no assistance. \n \nASIA: \n \nThe region is seeing several countries emerging from lockdown, we are also seeing many businesses, countries such as Singapore have seen a second wave of viral cases and re-entered lockdown.\n \nAustralia: \nAs leaders, we all know that decisions during this time are time-critical and Emotional Intelligence (EQ) has never been more important.\n \nSome markets and countries will see the “blue sky and the green shoots” earlier than others. When the market starts to recover, we are likely to see competition for resources, particularly skilled people.\n \nWe expect executives will look for security, but many may be forced to take what they can get and at the remuneration being offered. This is likely to hold down salary growth. Companies will hire back on new terms and conditions.\n \nThere is “a way to go” but preparation is being done now for the “return to work”. We are seeing organisations hiring now for the future and technology is a major part of this executive search and selection procedure. In this time of uncertainty and as the business world changes, leaders either lead people well or fail. For many years Taplow Australia has used an Emotional Intelligence online assessment as part of the search and selection process.\n \nIndia: \nIndia’s core sector output contracted 6.5% in March, marking the worst performance by the key infrastructure areas going back to 2005, as the nationwide lockdown to combat the spread of Covid-19 stalled the economy. Crude oil production contracted 5.5%, natural gas 15.2%, refinery products 0.5%, fertilisers 11.9%, steel 13%, cement 24.7% and electricity 7.2% during the month. Coal was the only sector that grew - 4%. The pandemic is likely to impact the country’s economy through the four vectors Supply Disruptions; Global and Domestic Demand; Stress on banking, financial sectors and parameters; and Falling oil prices.\n \nTo address these adverse times, the Government Of India has been preparing strategies and action plans not only for business continuity and sectoral revival but also to improve Ease of Doing Business in the country by highlighting measures to improve the business environment in India. Measures are taken to boost Trade & Commerce, managing Corporate Affairs efficiently, providing stimulus to the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector in India, and General / sectoral relief measures with an economic impact.\n \nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) went all out to make ample liquidity available in the market and nudge banks to lend to the productive sectors of the economy, announcing measures to inject 3.74 trillion. RBI has delivered rate cuts and more than $50 billion of liquidity injections in recent weeks.\n \nMicro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME) account for a third of the country's economy and employ more than 11 crore people (and hence highly vulnerable to the lockdown). Public Sector Undertaking’s (PSU’s) have been directed to settle bills raised by MSMEs to ensure the latter’s working capital requirements are met.\n \nThe government is not fighting it alone. Several corporates are continuing to extend as much support as possible. It is envisaged that during the fiscals 2020 to 2025, sectors such as energy (24%), roads (18%), urban (17%) and railways (12%) amount to circa 71% of the projected infrastructure investments in India, with a total capital expenditure projected at Circa Rs. 111 lakh crores. \n \nIndia is working on improving its project preparation process, enhancing the execution capacity of private sector participants, the sanctity of contracts, dispute resolution mechanisms, strengthening quality infrastructure, and revitalising bond and credit markets.\n \nSingapore: 3,000 FIRMS NOTIFIED MOM ABOUT COST-CUT MOVES. \nThe Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has received notification from 3,000 firms with about 100,000 employees to take wage cuts or nudging employees to go on no-pay leave amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n \nCompanies with at least 10 employees that intend to cut salaries by 25 percent or more during the circuit breaker period must inform MOM. \n \nAcross industries, wage cuts are likely to happen “swiftly and sharply” in the transportation and storage, and financial services industries, where remuneration is highly responsive to changes in business cycle conditions. Remuneration in financial services is also expected to suffer, while “significant” monthly wage declines can be expected in the accommodation and food services industry due to lower hours worked, the central bank of Singapore pointed out.\n \nOver at Grab which employees more than 3,000 staff in Singapore have been encouraged to go on voluntary no-pay leave, and the salaries of its senior management have been cut by up to 20 percent.\n \nNew Zealand: \nThe following insights are credited to the BNZ (one of New Zealand’s major Banks) and in particular their Head of Research – Stephen Toplis who we have great admiration for his insights – Stephen tells it like it is.\n \nBNZ reported that the business environment was atrocious in April. This was however not surprising given that for many New Zealander’s there wasn’t even a marketplace, or if there was, it was severely impeded by lockdown restrictions at alert level four (New Zealand’s highest Alert level). BNZ did state that the data they have collated, also confirmed, however, a glimmer of hope appearing toward the end of April as a move to alert level three became real.\n \nBy moving to Alert Level 3 on the 28th April 2020, meaning 500,000 more New Zealanders were at work. Of these, manufacturing, forestry, and construction were the biggest beneficiaries along with online retail, takeaways, distribution, and transport. At Alert level 4, approximately 40% of the economy was closed. By going to Alert Level 3, this they believe reduced to 24%.\n \nFor the country to move to Alert level 2 will require no community transmission and several days of zero change to the number of cases (confirmed cases in New Zealand have been tracking in single digits for the past fortnight). There will also need to be a sign that confirmed clusters are shrinking along with the New Zealand Government having confidence in its contact tracing capability. It is expected that the New Zealand Government will decide if they will move to Alert Level 2 in the week commencing 11th May 2020.\n \nIf the decision is made to go to Alert level 2, this will likely see most businesses back in operation rather than the ‘working from home’ model that exists for most under Level’s 4 and 3. It is anticipated that Schools and Universities will recommence. Larger gatherings will be allowed of up to 100 indoors or up to 500 outdoors. It is also anticipated that at this level 15% of the economy will, unfortunately, remain closed\n \nBNZ predicts that the biggest hits for the New Zealand economy are international tourism, our hospitality industry, commercial property, and discretionary spend on goods and services. On the upside, they believe the potential winners to be infrastructure, the digital economy, import-substituting manufacturing, call centers, and online retailers,\n \nBNZ believes that it will take years to get back to normal. The international backdrop will be problematic for some time. They predict that population growth will be much lower, and the unemployment rate will stay lofty. The income effects will be huge and asset prices thumped. International and Domestic tourism, New Zealand’s lifeline, is likely to be in disarray for some time (but we are not alone with that one).\n \nIn summary, BNZ believes the outlook is brightening, but unfortunately, the pain is yet to be fully felt. A return to “normal” is in their view years away, but one thing they are very certain about is that the world will never be the same so it is about adjusting as quickly as possible to whatever the new norm looks like.\n \nSource – BNZ - From Rescue to Recovery – A New Zealand Chart Pack – 1st May 2020\n \nEUROPE:\n \nThe region has suffered in unequal parts over the last few weeks, although a flattening of the curve of infections is starting to show as well as many countries starting to move out of “lockdown” periods and allowing business to reopen again. \n \nFrance: \nThe prime minister officially announced the progressive end of the lockdown in France on 11th May 2020. Since the end of April, the number of dead from COVID19 is slowly decreasing but the government is very aware of avoiding a virus strike back if France unlocks too quickly without taking all the required measures.\n \nOn one hand, the end of the lockdown has to be very progressive on selected areas, depending on the level of COVID 19 infection, and on selected sectors (for instance, all activities involving people gathering such as restaurants, cinemas, museum, etc. will not open until further notice, and at least not before summer).\n \nOn the other hand, the French government wants to avoid the collapse of the economy (they expect a GDP decline of 16% in the second quarter of 2020 which would lead to a recession of almost 9% for the whole 2020 year!). Ministry of Labour is currently working with professional federations on dedicated guides for each sector on how to restart their activities while taking in account all the measures to protect their employees and partners from COVID 19 in the months to come (masks available, reorganizing the working space, promote remote work for all positions where it may apply, etc.).\n \nAfter 11th May 2020, the government will reassess the situation every 3 weeks depending on how the infection is evolving. To sum up, it is a difficult balance between avoiding a new development of the disease and relaunching the economy as soon as possible. At the time being 93% of construction projects are stopped and the number of short-time workers has reached 10 million people.\n \nGermany: \nSmall and medium-large shops can open again, Hotels and Restaurants are still closed as well as conference centers, fairgrounds, and likes.\n \nThe pressure by both employer associations and unions on the politics to return to \"business as usual\" is growing. Predictions say that the GNP in Germany will fall by 6% (optimistic view) or more. At least more than during the financial crisis 2008/2009.\n \nGDP is an important focus here, not GNP, The downturns in GDP in Q1 in France, Italy and Spain were reported at a higher percentage than in Germany, but as going back to business is still unclear, the per annual downturn could be highest in Germany - because of highest export and international dependencies. There exist reputable scenarios of total GDP downturn between 7 and 11 percent this year \n \nA lot of conversations with business partners these days. But: my standard business may start again January 2021 at the best-evaluated guess.\n \nFinancial Services, especially Private Equity, and Real Estate: execution continues for most existing deals, deals in preparation may be done or be postponed for 6 months or more, nearly no new deals are started: sellers still want high prices, buyers want lower prices and are unsure what the real values are and so they wait\n \nProfessional Services: There are some special effects in topics like Regulatory and Risk and Business Recovery, but most business there will decrease, and they will cut employment in \n \nQ2, especially in all advisory business including ICT which could be delayed or put on a longer scale. Producers across-industries including ICT producers: some businesses may continue or sometimes even increase employee base; many will benefit from government initiatives. \n \nRussia:\n Russian economists estimate that 30-50% of production is standing still in April. This likely makes it the worst month in the Russian economy since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Consumer goods producers are still doing fine. Procter and Gamble with two factories in Russia are one of the companies declared by the state to be a critical enterprise. This allows them to continue production 24/7 while all white collars work from home. \n \nSimilar situations can be noted by Taplow Russia in its FMCG clients. Budget brands are doing good but there are worries about premium brands. President Putin announced a continuation of the non-working days through the May holidays until the 11\nth\n May 2020.\n \nSpain\n: The Spanish Government has forecasted a 9.2% decrease in GDP in 2020. Conversely, there will be a 6.2% rise in GDP throughout 2021.\n \nWe have good forecasts for the pharmaceutical industry (Example: Many R&D pharma companies are researching a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as new testing methods), and the tech sector (Example: Spain is ranked as one of the top countries for cybersecurity services)\n \nPrivate Equity firms are resorting to liquidity to maintain results in portfolio companies. PE firms are also ready to undertake new acquisitions.\n \nUK: \nAlthough currently lockdown, many UK businesses are reopening or have plans to reopen in May 2020. Construction, retail, fast food sectors are seeing contractors and major players restarting their businesses. The UK economy will suffer a 40% decrease in GDP for March 2020, Government departments are planning a staged easing of the lockdown, many experts believe Mid May will see the start of these plans. We have seen clients hire or take to the final stage of the hiring process many projects utilising technology that will surely become part of the “\nNew Normal\n” in the hiring process as the lockdown eases and eventually finishes. \n \nAMERICAS:\n \nThe Americas and particularly regions in the USA are the new epicentre of the pandemic. \n \nBrazil\n: Is entering its 6th week of involvement during the Pandemic situation. As of today, about 2.200 deaths and over 35.000 cases of infection were officially registered in Brazil. Many more are occurring for sure, due to the impossibility of mass testing. Most of the cases are concentrated in the states of São Paulo, and the Northern area – States of Amazon and in Ceará. \n \nIt is estimated that the 2020 Brazilian GDP will reach a -5,00% figure from an already low prior estimate of 1,5% growth, based on a consistent low basis from the past years. It will be a major disaster! Companies/clients are extremely far from demanding recruiting services. It is estimated that this scenario will be here for the rest of 2020.\n \nPotential services demand, in our estimation, will be mostly related to human capital initiatives – organizational studies, adaptation to the “new normal”, coaching help and the like, before going into an actual recruitment demand period. Organizations will also be able to recompose their cash flow!\n \nUSA and Canada: \nAs employees start to return to offices, some companies will find they need less space than before. Some workers who went remote during the pandemic will want to stay remote in the long term. Other companies will require more square footage to provide adequate spacing between workers. For the first time in decades, companies in locations with high real- estate prices may find it more cost-effective to provide individual offices. With advances in modular glass walls, it is now possible to create tiny offices that do not feel claustrophobic. \n \nKey Finding:\n \n \nCompanies: \nAre planning there back to work strategies with local Government guidance. \n \nExecutives: \nAre grappling with new routes to market, the divergence of manufacturing or service offerings to succeed in the “\nNew Normal\n”. \n \nCompanies are reassessing: \nWorking practices, in the cessation of lockdown, new ways of producing products, servicing clients need to be quickly identified and actioned \n \nNo one: \nIs predicting the quick return to “business as usual”. \n \n \n \n \nWe hope that you, your family, and work colleagues continue to stay healthy and safe, we at Taplow are here to support you and your company through this crisis and we look forward to speaking to you again soon.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3352)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Further, it can be defined as a measure of economic value achieved by the firm due to the expertise of its employees. The term human capital is a relatively new addition to the business scenario of a firm. It was coined by economists Gary Becker and Theodore Schultz in the year 1960. \nHuman Capital Management\n also includes providing an employee with education, research, and training. It will ensure the innovation of creative ideas and the continuous development of skills to reap more significant benefits for the organization. \n \nThe success of an organization depends on how the human capital manages the financial and intellectual capital. This highlights the importance of human capital. Even though technology is replacing redundant jobs, yet you need a human being to develop and run those technologies. We see a shift in demand from unskilled human capital to highly skilled and well-trained human resources. As of March 2020, the global unemployment rate is at 7.7% (the USA at 4.4%). The rate has steadily declined over the years. It means that finding the right talent has become even more challenging. This brings us to the benefits of investing in human capital - \n \n \nLower Attrition rates \n \nImproved client engagement\n \nIncreased employee productivity and engagement\n \nIncrease in the organization's profits \n \n \nThe current pandemic has brought the world to a standstill. The spread of COVID19 globally has contained humans to stay within the premises of their homes. This pandemic has made working from home a new normal. Just like any other function, the search for human capital has also gone remote. In such a scenario, the search for talented candidates has become all the more challenging. An organization cannot leverage its grand infrastructure or work culture to attract a potential employee. The challenges for human capital development can be:\n \n \nBuilding a trusting environment\n \nRestricted communication \n \nTechnological and technical difficulties \n \nEmployee engagement\n \nAttracting the right talent for the position \n \n \nIn a world where one's home serves as an office, the traditional methods of contacting a potential employee have become irrelevant. An organization needs to have a digital presence to search the right candidates and communicate the value of joining the organization. Now it is a daunting task to scout for the right talent, conduct interviews, and find out whether the person is aligned with the organization's values and culture. Under normal circumstances, this seems challenging, let alone working remotely.\n \nIn such a situation, many organizations look for executive search companies to bridge this gap. Outsourcing the executive search process seems to be the best way out. Executive search firms have a pool of highly talented and experienced professionals. They understand your business and find the right match for your need. With this model, companies eliminate overhead costs, costs of hiring etc.\n \nExecutive search firms have become a significant platform for connecting with the potential human capital. It gives you the liberty of connecting with talented human capital across the globe. \n \nSome of the unique and exciting strategies to attract the right talent adopted by executive search firms are\n \n \nHaving an active social media presence and participation in relevant discussions\n \nDeveloping networks everywhere right from LinkedIn to Facebook\n \nLeverage from existing employees' network \n \n \nHowever, all these strategies need expertise and manpower. Human Capital search remotely needs an organization to dig deeper. It is not only about skills but also how far one is willing to search for the right candidate. And the executive search firms have the right talent, skill and mind set to find you the right candidate.  The right candidate will bring original ideas and contribute to the revenue of the firm. The remote search might require additional patience and time, but one can still manage the human capital search in the most effective manner.\nAt The Taplow Group we have extensive experience in designing, delivering and benchmarking Human Capital projects in addition to Human Capital Search, to ensure our clients fully realize their employees’ full potential.

A rising number of factories are forced to freeze their operations while others are trying to minimise costs by optimising production. The pressure on some companies is continously increasing to consider dismissing their employees and sectors like automotive are struggling to receive parts from Europé, which are necessary for their production to continue.\n\n\nGladly, on the other side, we also see that the companies are trying to avoid dismissals by putting their staff on vacation or reduce the weekly working hours. Food retail had significant volumes in March due to many people stocking up products. And also companies in the region are slowly starting to get back to work again. Even though it is estimated that Russia will reach its peak in late May, the overall tenor when we speak with our clients and business contacts is optimistic. Yes, it is a very uncertain situation, but a volatile market like Russia is used to adaptation and staying agile. Another positive effect is the rise of digital transformation and home office, which is still underdeveloped in most companies. The business will go on, and companies are even hiring and preparing to go back to full speed as soon as possible. For us at The Taplow Group, Russia this situation is an opportunity that provides us the perfect window to utilize our efficient process and capability to work with digital solutions to contact candidates and conduct interviews from wherever we are and deliver the best quality in time!\n\n\nHenric Nilsson, Managing Partner, The Taplow Group Russia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3367)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Taplow partners across the globe have combined to give insights into how their countries/ markets are seeing the impact on business and the positives that are starting to shine through.\n \nAFRICA:\n \nAlthough Africa has not seen as many cases primarily due to there being less travel spreading the pandemic, notable clusters are emerging.\n \nSouth Africa:\nThe pandemic is seeing countries in Africa going into various versions of “lockdown”. The business community is striving to come to terms with the situation with the backdrop of little or in some countries no assistance.\n \nASIA:\n \nThe region is seen as being “ahead of the pandemic curve” although the signs are encouraging, the predicted end to the region’s  crisis is still to be realised.\n \nAustralia:\n They say a day in politics can be a long time and in the current global conditions the changes daily are rapid. In Australia, there has been a closure of the borders and this has been the case in many countries. This has seen a huge decrease in the volume of international passenger flights to and from Australia. Many of these passenger flights carry cargo in their belly, high-value exports and imports. The Australian Government Austrade Website has insights on the world regions. To China for instance, “there are now only 108 international passenger flights into China per week under new restrictions to minimise the risk of COVID-19 cases entering the country. The number of weekly international cargo flights has increased to 1,195 (up 28.5% in the past week and 17.85% compared to pre-COVID-19 levels).” The Australian Government has issued an advisory stating that it is supporting “extra freight-only flights. This includes 55 commercial freight-only flights that have been scheduled for April. This comes to a total of  540 services for this month. To support Australian exporters, Australian Airlines Qantas and Virgin Australia are offering air freight capacity on repatriation of international passenger services to Auckland, Hong Kong, Los Angeles and London, from Thursday 9 April 2020. While these services are limited, this will give Australian producers a way to obtain valuable inputs for their businesses. It is expected that the return flights to Australia will bring in vital medicines, medical supplies and equipment to support Australia’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.”\n \nA link to the Austrade: \nhttps://tinyurl.com/yct28dfe\n \nIndia:\n \nAs per the World Bank's latest assessment, India is expected to grow 1.5 percent to 2.8 percent. Similarly, the IMF projected a GDP growth of 1.9 percent for India in 2020, as the global economy hits the worst recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s. The coronavirus pandemic came at a time when India’s economy was already slowing, due to persistent financial sector weaknesses. The severe disruption of economic activities caused by COVID-19, both through demand and supply shocks, has overtaken the incipient recovery in the Indian economy leading to massive job losses. As per the analysts, combined with the disruption in several manufacturing and service sectors, it is now estimated that the economic loss in 2020 will be close to $234.4 billion or 8.1% of GDP if India will remain under a partial lockdown at least until the end of May.  However, for India, IMF has estimated a sharp economic recovery in FY22 at 7.4%. Prime Minister Narendra Modi reviewed the impact of COVID-19 on the Indian economy and discussed a possible second stimulus with India’s Finance Minister to boost sectors hit hard by the pandemic. The focus will again be aimed at the urban and rural poor; disadvantaged sections of society; Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises sector; and some of the worst-affected sectors.  The Finance Minister last month announced an INR 1.7 core stimulus that included free food-grains and cooking gas to poor for three months, and cash to women and poor senior citizens as it looked to ease the economic impact of the nationwide lockdown. One of the reasons why markets have recovered is because it is expecting a stimulus from the government. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has further announced several liquidity and credit easing measures and given relaxation to banks and financial institutions to ensure markets continue functioning, and credit and liquidity is provided to impacted sectors. RBI cuts reverse repo by 25 bps to 3.75%, announces liquidity steps for NBFCs.\n \nSingapore:\n Singapore Bank’s, Credit rating agency Moody’s Investors Service has downgraded its outlook on Singapore’s banking system to “negative” as the city-state grapples with an economic slowdown and declining interest rates amid the COVID-19 pandemic. As of 18th April, there are more than 5000 cases. Problem assets will increase as delinquencies grow among small and medium-sized enterprises and larger corporations. To this end, credit costs are slated to rise in tandem with worsening interest rates, causing a drag on the profitability of banks. This will further impede the banks’ ability to generate capital.  Even so, they note that funding and liquidity will remain strong given Singapore banks’ historical strength in liquidity coverage and high net stable funding ratios that exceed 100%.\n \nNew Zealand:\n \nIt has been reported that New Zealand exports have held up while imports are weaker. Sources state that exports were up 13.2 percent compared on the same week in March 2019, while total imports were down 3.9 percent, and weaker demand is expected in the coming weeks.  Looking from a positive angle, we understand that Chinese domestic activity is slowly recovering, which we believe will be great news for New Zealand, as the trade figures between China and New Zealand (both ways) is reportedly worth more than $30 billion, so any recovery in China is a good sign for New Zealand. The most optimistic scenarios released by the New Zealand Treasury last week suggest a 4.5% drop in GDP, which will take two years to recover, in part because unemployment will more than double. Also, on the downside, best estimates reportedly suggest that GDP could contract by 3.1% between the December 2019 and March 2020 quarters, with a further 5.6% contraction between the March and June 2020 quarters. The hit already taken by the tourism sector is the primary driver for the reduction. In addition, some of New Zealand’s commodity exports, particularly to China, have also taken an impact. As stated in many publications, the ultimate impact on the economy will be determined by how many people lose their jobs. Unfortunately, as reported in the last update, there are already major job losses occurring, with tourism being the biggest contributor to this impact. Economists predict that the hospitality, sports, arts, and entertainment sectors are next. Following this the ‘public-facing’ sectors particularly Retail will be forced to retrench staff following the expected ‘frenzy’ that is likely to occur following New Zealand coming out of lockdown. Sources state that there are around 400,000 people employed in the retail, accommodation, and hospitality sector. There are a further 160,000 employed in sports, arts and culture. By doing the numbers, if 10% were to lose their jobs then employment would drop by 56,000. However, our reading suggests that this number is going to be far greater. Counterbalancing these are the sectors that are likely to grow and these include the infrastructure development sector (including telecommunications companies), call centres, horticulture and finally our health sector which is “singing out” for staff (the latter is very much a global issue).\n \nEUROPE:\n \nThe region has suffered in unequal parts over the last few weeks. A flattening of the curve of infections is starting to show along with the movement of many countries out of the “lockdown” periods and allowing the business to open again.\n \nFrance:\n The Governor of the Banque de France announced that the French GDP fell by 6% in the first quarter of 2020. This is indeed the worst figure since the quarterly statistic’s existence, i.e. since the second world war. It confirms the estimates used by INSEE: the lockdown \"costs\" at 3% per month. It started on March 17, and thus costed 1.5% of annualized GDP in the first quarter (6%/4), noting that the growth was close to zero between January 1 and mid-March. We can imagine that the lockdown, which will be extended until May 11th, will have a deep impact on GDP in the second quarter of 2020. As the end of the lockdown promises to be very gradual, the decline in GDP will continue probably until the end of June; it could reach - 20% (impact of -5% on annual GDP). The decline in national GDP could exceed -10%.  On the social side, the number of employees on short-time working has reached 8 million people.\n \nFinland:\n \nTaplow Finland strengthened its team with the addition of senior executive, Matti Copeland joining Taplow Finland. In this unprecedented time when businesses are facing big challenges and predicting the future is nearly impossible, Taplow Finland invested in growth and making sure that we have the best team on board. With Matti’s joining, Taplow Finland benefits from his 30 -year career in leadership roles within investment banking, private equity/venture capital and strategy. Matti has worked for companies such as Citibank, Nordea, Capman, Deloitte, Basware and most recently with EY. He has also served on numerous boards and acted as an angel investor supporting Finnish technology entrepreneurs. “Taplow is known in the market for working as a team and with Matti on board, the diversity and professional business acumen gets a good upgrade” says Timo Toivanen, the Managing Partner of Taplow Finland. “Due to his diverse background and an open mind, we are naming Matti as Taplow Finland´s \nChief Curiosity Officer\n”, He further added.\n \nGermany:\n We see a growing market and are successfully offering consulting + executive search to Chinese (Asian) companies entering the German (European) market – in close collaboration with selected partners, as our Senior Advisor Manuel Vermeer who has 30 years of experience as a business advisor for Asia, International law firms and a market research institute. Consulting and law firms are adapting their service offering to the situation (e.g., cash-flow planning, liquidity analysis, purchasing, supply chain optimization, HR management, restructuring) and are preparing for the ramp-up phase. Some of them are massively increasing their investments and marketing activities. Certain industries, including aviation, oil & gas, and tourism & hospitality, are particularly impacted. The drawbacks in these areas will impact other industries as well. The automotive industry is also clearly impacted, but companies like VW, Daimler and BMW are restarting their production, depending on the availability of parts. The impact on the banking industry will depend on the number of insolvencies in the future. Decisive factors will be the duration of the fight against the virus and the success of the measures taken to avoid business failures.\n \nRussia:\n Current situation with an escalation of Corona cases, business in Russia is not easy to describe. On the one hand, small and medium-size companies are suffering the most. On the other hand, a lot of companies continue to maintain high productivity levels. Among such enterprises are producers of equipment for the oil and gas sector and construction firms. Food production is operating almost at the usual level as well as its suppliers. The packaging and logistics business experienced some issues, but it is reactivating now. The entertainment industry and catering business are indeed having a tough time in Russia. It is essential to mention that employees work from home-offices.\n \nUK:\n There has been a significant rise of business in the food, logistics and (of course) the healthcare sector. Many food retailers recruited thousands of staff although this has been tempered with several “non-food” retailers going into administration. The logistics and delivery market has seen a remarkable period of growth, one that we see continuing, “post virus” as companies seek to \nnear source\n services, goods, and suppliers. The financial markets have continued throughout the pandemic and we are starting to see financial groups from Asia and the Middle East move into the UK market and seek acquisitions in numerous sectors. We anticipate senior management recruitment to grow in HR, Risk Management and Financial sectors as clients move from “\nnear term survival\n” to the “\nnew normal\n” of business life.\n \nAMERICAS:\n \nThe Americas are fast becoming the new epicentre of the pandemic.\n \nBrazil:\n Brazil is  entering its 6th week of involvement during the Pandemic situation. As of today, about 2.200 deaths and over 35.000 cases of infection have been officially registered in Brazil. Many more are occurring for sure due to the impossibility of mass testing. Most of the cases are concentrated in the states of São Paulo, and in the Northern area  States of Amazon and in Ceará.\n \n \nThe Central Government is also prorogating/postponing public debt payments for all Brazilian states.\n \n \nBusiness Outlook\n \n \nIt is estimated that the 2020 Brazilian GDP will reach a -5.00% figure from an already low prior estimate of 1.5% growth, based on a consistent low basis from the past years. It will be a major disaster!\n \nCompanies/clients are extremely far from demanding recruiting services. It is estimated that this scenario will be here for the rest of 2020.\n \nOur action, from our homework possibilities, just like everybody else, will be to feed clients with news, such as your expected excerpts and other pertaining information and possible phone calls offering any kind of potential help. Potential services demand, in our estimation, will be mostly related to human capital initiatives – organizational studies, adaptation to the “new normal”, coaching help and the like, before going into an actual recruitment demand period. Organizations will also be able to recompose their own cash flow!\n \n \nUSA and Canada:\n \nIt presents a very mixed story! Our US business is not as strong as it was in Q1 of 2019.  We are actively engaged with North American, APAC and European firms seeking to enhance their relationships and business in the US and US-based firms seeking to plan for international growth.  Recent conversations suggest that a good deal of planning is going on for how we will need to respond after the worst of the crisis is over. \n \nThe Good\n: All but the most marginal US businesses are adjusting to the new normal of dealing with the Corvid 19 pandemic.  Some, particularly capital-intensive businesses such as airlines, as well as major medical facilities will have to be both creative and rely on government aid to make it through this time. Pharma (Life Sciences), Tech and communications services providers seemingly will do well.  New industries such as “just in time” home delivery business models will fill in with many new jobs.  Entrepreneurs will tighten their belt and adjust their business to this transient state.\n \nThe Bad:\n  The US economy has suffered the most severe setback ever seen during our current working lifetime.  Approximately 18,000,000 US workers have applied for unemployment benefits in the last 4 weeks and over 2 million small businesses have applied for some form of financial relief. Response times are slow and according to some news media, we have already fully used the relief funds approved by our Congress and signed by our President. Social distancing, state, local government and various international quarantines and travel bans have made doing business even more difficult.  As we originally planned for the possibility of a modest downturn during 2020, we now must cope with the negative performance for several quarters  that could possibly extend well into next year.\n \nThe Ugly:\n As we are about to approach another round of elections, we are distracted by the political theater and seeming distraction of many current leaders.  The lack of respect for scientifically based solutions vs. a hurry to get back to normal might result in lessened ability to normalize than might otherwise be expected.  We note that business leaders around the world seem to be more concerned about a sustainable recovery than a quick recovery.\n \nA variety of analysts and pundits have suggested that there are at least 5 possibilities we should plan for:\n \n \nA gradual recovery – what some are calling the “U” shaped recovery, which perhaps will take up to 3 years.\n \nFits and starts – exactly as defined – steps forward and steps backward making the planning of all sorts exceedingly difficult\n \nA worst-case scenario in which even after the virus is contained, we have joblessness, business failures and personal bankruptcies for an extended time due to continued shutdowns without scientific break advances to completely contain the virus\n \nA major correction including a “lessons learned” response by business, government and our other entities’\n \nChanges we cannot envision today – we all would like and need some level of certainty as we have lost that for some time.\n \n \nKey Finding:\n \n \nCompanies \nare planning their exit from enforced lockdown across the globe.\n \nExecutives \nface meeting the challenges of the “\nnew normal\n”, questions such as, do they have the right people in place to prosper in their marketplaces?\n \nCompanies are reassessing their \nworking practices. In the cessation of lockdown, new ways of producing products and servicing clients need to be quickly identified and actioned\n \nNo one anticipates \n2020 to be as forecasted! 2021 is the year companies aim for a return to growth.\n \n \nWe hope that you, your family, and work colleagues continue to stay healthy and safe. We at The Taplow Group are here to support you and your company through this crisis and we look forward to connecting with you again soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3373)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "How Leadership Development Coaching Helps Manage Crisis Better\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nMonday, April 20, 2020\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current coronavirus pandemic is threatening, both lives and livelihoods across the globe. Catastrophes happen and most of the time we don’t have any control over them. However, our response as leaders is something we do have a control over, and that’s what more often than not defines the outcome of any crisis. As a leader one cannot predict crisis but can always stay prepared to face them and \nleadership development coaching\n is one such tool that prepares the leaders to face such upheavals with aplomb.\n\n\nLeadership development coaching is defined as a process where a leader receives leadership coaching from a special coach in order to become an effective leader. Always remember that as a leader you are responsible for actions that you take during a crisis. Therefore, leadership development is also an integral part of crisis management of an organization and leadership development coaching is considered to be a sound investment.\n\n\nMost of the skills that the leaders must bring to the fore during crises are the skills that leadership development coaching frequently addresses. The top 3 skills for leadership coaching are communication, decision-making, and delegation. It is a combination of these skills that enables the leaders to navigate the unexpected turbulence.\n\n\nLeadership development coaching helps leaders to –\n\n\nBecome aware\n – This is true for both self and situational awareness. Leadership coaching prepares the leader not only to be self-aware during a crisis but also be aware of the situation around them to react appropriately.\n\n\nBe self confident\n – Leaders who under go leadership development coaching are more self confident as they have already enabled themselves to overcome their fears and self limiting thoughts and beliefs through leadership coaching.\n\n\nDevelop self-leadership\n – Leadership development coaching helps leader to develop their ability to lead themselves with more compassion and self-acceptance.\n\n\nLeadership coaching also a critical tool for organizational change as it helps to develop key people into leaders. Effectively designed leadership development coaching programs use action and experiment to develop leaders. A crisis situation, for example the current pandemic, not only calls for short-term firefighting measures but also for a long-term planning. Leadership development programs enable leaders across all levels to develop their skills, increase their effectiveness and maximize their potential.\n\n\nAn excellent and structured leadership development coaching program benefits next generation of leaders, leaders who come into the organization from the outside, and current leaders who need to up their game to meet new strategic and global challenges.\n\n\nFor example, leadership coaching for experienced leaders helps them to redefine their success metrics, reevaluate their leadership style, rearrange their priorities, be prepared for exigencies, and lead their teams to success.\n\n\nSimilarly, it is through a leadership development coaching program that an aspiring leader, can understand what are the essentials to be successful in an organization, develop their own leadership style, and create a robust development plan in tandem with their future aspirations.\n\n\nIf you are interested in developing and preparing your leaders for today’s and tomorrow’s unpredictable times then please reach out to us at  \nwww.Taplowgroup.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (4563)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "Navigating the Post Pandemic World Order - Our Take\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nsocialmedia@taplowgroup.com\n/\nThursday, April 16, 2020\n/\nCategories: \nNews\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAs the world battles Covid-19, countries have triggered containment measures that have half of humanity in lock down. Not to mention the economic impact of a magnitude that is the most defining event since the Great Depression. A McKinsey report described this as an imminent restructuring of the global economic order.\n\n\nWith Global debt spiraling, several people, businesses, companies, industries and even countries are close to default. Much of the debt build up in corporates is in the old economy sectors, where current disruption to supply chains and sudden stop in current consumption and earnings has created a crisis of staying solvent, requiring Governments to step in to bail them out. With the prospects of Global growth in the near future remaining bleak, a recession has been officially signaled, and a depression spoken about in hushed whispers. To prevent wider collapse in markets, most Central Banks have stepped in with interest rate cuts and increase in money supply.\n\n\nThe narrative is already grim, without even considering the unprecedented loss of lives. The enormity and the frantic pace of the economic impact is straight out of a doomsday scenario. Washington Post reported that in the United States of America 10 million jobs have already been lost in the past two weeks, which is in sharp contrast with the 2008 Lehman led crisis when 8.8 million jobs were lost, but spread over a -gentle by comparison-106 weeks. Just as the sharing economy had made painstaking progress in carving out legitimacy for itself, this crisis is likely to create a big setback. SoftBank which had big bets on Uber, Ola, Oyo is already in the negative territory.\n\n\nBusiness Impact across Demand, Supply & Human Resource\n\n\nThrough our conversations with business leaders, HR leaders and Economists, we have tried to capture broadly how different industries, based on their business models, are going to experience this crisis with varying degrees of intensity.\n\n\nDemand from Customers\n\n\nConsumer spending is grinding to a halt as fears of the pandemic keep people away from shopping centers, restaurants, movie theaters and workplaces. Aviation, hospitality and commercial real estate are amongst the worst hit sectors and are hanging in by a thread. Hospitality for example, will struggle to navigate the new reality. Business hotels will suffer a steep drop in occupancy owing to increased WFH and videoconferencing, and remote leisure resorts will witness a reduction in footfalls owing to increased cost and complexity of approach (e.g. reduced flight frequencies and increased fares), besides an anticipated stigma related to travel.\n\n\nOn the other hand, a few businesses like supermarkets, medical supplies and equipment, delivery- especially the last mile home delivery solutions will see a surge. Movement in healthcare to boost immunity will generate momentum.\n\n\nDirect to Consumer- Consumers were already shifting their spending away from physical stores and may now permanently adjust their buying habits for certain categories toward e-commerce. Post Covid-19, organizations will accelerate their direct to consumer strategy with specific focus on last mile delivery and logistics capability through a mix of strategic alliances with online players and delivery service providers. Under the current scenario, this trend will manifest itself quickly with a number of traditional retail brands ditching their avowed distance from e-commerce channels to swiftly try and integrate with online platforms.\n\n\nSupply Chain Disruption\n\n\nOver the last two decades, the globalized economy and the mantra of economies of scale has shifted the supply chain of most industries to China. Only time will tell, if we will see an end to globalization and emergence of regional supply centers, as a fallout of this crisis. In the very least, we will see a shift and broad basing of manufacturing hubs to other developing countries.\n\n\nWhile India has always positioned itself to be an alternate from a cost, resource and geo logistics standpoint, the business friendly environment and agility of countries in the ASEAN region may pip India’s policy makers’ efforts to attract the much needed investment that the country requires in the post Covid-19 period.\n\n\nOrganizational Human Resource Impact\n\n\nOrganizations are being forced to test their Work from Home infrastructure. Our conversations with HR leaders clearly state that technology is being leveraged, like never before, to maintain business continuity.  Consulting businesses are operating remotely which typically happened on client sites. Companies have moved their technical centers to people’s homes.\n\n\nThis will also lead to the evolution of the current theory of Organization Behavior and Development, which looks at Office Settings and interaction as a key variable in productive office dynamics. Today, managers are driving their teams and new employees are joining the work force and getting on-board the organization remotely, and employees are picking up work related skills and nuances remotely. Technology adaption will be essential across all roles.\n\n\nLeaders and managers will need to re-learn how to motivate their teams – virtual TGIF anyone? Work From Home – coupled with social distancing necessitates individuals to cope with the lack of fulfilling their innate need for socialization and manage the additional pressure of other family members at home. While some industries especially distributed tech teams have been practicing this way of work in a limited way, the entire team working individually is a new reality for which all professionals will need to be prepared for.\n\n\nThere isn’t any blue book available but sooner or later, a mass remote working practice will emerge effectively across all sectors. Lots of not so called non-essential work would be automated further, strategy duration will be further shortened.\n\n\nStreamlining Businesses and Processes:\n Companies at this point are forced to innovate and streamline their businesses to stay relevant. Organizations, with the luxury of free band-width or overcapacity, are using this time to look at strategic capability gaps and design futuristic policies.\n\n\nTechnology is the driver\n\n\nInvestment portfolio of traditional industries will see a radical change as they wake up to technology investment as the steady guarantee to uninterrupted production. Bots and AI which are beyond pandemic and can be remotely operated would be the new awakening of the ‘old-school’ Board or CEOs. They would realize that the investment on technology that was put off would have to take precedence over all else.\n\n\nPost Covid-19, work from home products and services will evolve into business essentials and would not just be relegated to a remote contingency plan. The WFH category is already experiencing huge pent up demand to be fulfilled as soon as the current curb on movement is lifted.\n\n\nConserving Financial Capital and Human Capital\n\n\nAll leaders need to focus on is the basics i.e., conserving cash while evaluating deferment of projects with investments earmarked for future growth and development unless they relate to their response to the Covid-19 led challenge.\n\n\nDespite the fear, many businesses and communities have shown a more altruistic response in the face of crisis. A section of large companies that are able to withstand some of the pandemic pressures are putting People before Profit. They are taking measures to ensure safety of their employees, consistently communicating and engaging with them, helping them to stay focused, purposeful and centered. They are using this time to build their people brand. People are going to remember how they were treated. So create that lasting impact on people!\n\n\nThe world has already commenced its journey to thrive both life and livelihood together which will be the new normal for the times to come. “Re-imagine” is the new verb that embraces us on all fronts whether our professional or our personal beings. Mankind under this crisis is witnessing revolution and evolution for once at the same pace competing with each other.\n\n\nHowever, the world will move, mankind will continue to thrive but in different formats. And with that will emerge a set of organizations which will be stronger and agile and a new workforce that will be more resilient\n\n\n \n\n\nThis article has been contributed by\n Vrinda Guleria, Principal\n, \nThe Taplow Group, India\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (3052)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Not only does it require to keep one’s skills updated, but also learn new ones. As a leader, your team is an important part of your business and its talent development is your responsibility. Who would know better than you how your people work? And what talent development they need in order to perform better! Always remember that people need training and support throughout their careers, both as individuals and as a part of a team to develop their skills and continue to work effectively.\n\n\nAlso, team talent development is an essential part of overall organizational success as it provides the organization with the skilled workforce to meet its current and future milestones. With most of us working from home nowadays, there is more time available for investing in talent development. As a leader you should make the most of this opportunity and engage in talent development of your team.\n\n\nThere are several ways to look at \nteam talent development\n. The whole idea behind talent development is to get the best out of your team and achieve your organizational objectives at the same time. However, like everything else in life, the hardest part is where to begin! Here are 3 steps to help to ace your team talent development goals.\n\n\nIdentify what your team needs to learn\n\n\nThe first step in team talent development should be to understand your team members’ development needs. Review their job description and assess their work. This would give you a clarity on what and how your team is doing. Talk to your team and ask them relevant questions like how do they think they can perform their job better. Talking to your team about what they need to be more successful in their roles will help them develop a positive feeling about learning something new. Add your analysis to it and voila you have your team talent development sketch ready.\n\n\nCustomize learning programs for your team members\n\n\nOnce you have done the assessment for their need to develop certain skills, you would know exactly what kind of talent development training would help them. Each team member would have different roles, responsibilities, objectives, talents, levels of understanding, and personal capacity. For talent development, it is very essential that learning programs are customized for individual needs. For example, if one team member has cited ‘Excel’ as a pain point for herself or himself, it would be a total waste of time to do the talent development training for the whole team. Therefore, it is important that team talent development content should be as unique as the individual it’s meant to upskill.\n\n\nShow your commitment to your team member’s talent development\n\n\nYou must show your team members that you truly care for them and will support them for their talent development efforts. It’s vital for you as a leader to listen and understand as to what the team really wants from their job and their perception of how they can contribute to the overall organizational success. Only then you will be able to manage the talented teams you’ve helped to create.\n\n\nDo you know that leaders who are actively involved in team talent development are much loved and respected by their teams! By doing so these leaders ensure that their team’s careers are both challenging and meaningful!\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, it is our constant endeavor to provide our partner organizations with the leadership talent they need in order to scale new heights.

    "content": "Taplow News- Pandemic Business Overview\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nMark Firth\n/\nMonday, April 6, 2020\n/\nCategories: \nNews\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCOVID-19, the global pandemic has been affecting businesses across every sector, in all parts of the world. Taplow partners have all come together to provide insights into how their countries/ markets are dealing with the pandemic and the impact on business. I thought it would be of interest to you and your team to gain a local, regional and global insight of the situation as of today.\n \nAFRICA:\n \nAfrica has not seen as many cases primarily because there was less travel spreading the pandemic. However, there are notable clusters emerging\n \nSouth Africa:\n Today enters day 10 of lockdown, concerns over a ‘second wave’ of COVID-19 infections and subsequent extended curfew poses significant socioeconomic fallouts. Since all three rating agencies last week downgraded South Africa to junk status, global investors that track this index will be forced to sell South African exposure. This will result in a mass outflow of capital of up to $12 billion according to analysts.\n \nASIA:\n \nThe region is seen as being “ahead of the pandemic curve” although the signs are encouraging, the predicted end to the regions crisis is still to be realised.\n \nAustralia:\n Australia is “Open for Business” in a diminished capacity. Some areas of the economy are busy; for instance, government is very busy providing support to the citizens and the economy. People have been asked to “stay home” and no more than two people are to be together when doing essential tasks like shopping for food or exercising. Financial Services and real estate will be challenged for a while because organisations will have worked out that they don’t need all the people they have or all the space they are leasing because they can have people work with more flexibility and from home. Financial planners may become financial counsellors to assist people through the debt they accumulate after being stood down or from losing their jobs. They will need technology to do this. Retail leasing is going to go through another round of “hurt” but warehousing and delivery services are going to grow as items are ordered and delivered.\n \nChina: \n Although the nationwide lockdown has been relaxed over the last two weeks based on the small success of curbing the spread of coronavirus, epidemic prevention and control in Mainland China will probably become a long-term normal, some medical experts said on Sunday. The major commercial centres for international exchanges, still bear the brunt of the risks as the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating, there is no chance to call off the tier 1 major cities’ prevention and control work in a short time. The government’s overall strategy of guarding against imported cases and a rebound in indigenous cases will remain unchanged, with scientific analysis of the epidemic situation and accurate control methods taken. This has highlighted the importance of seizing the critical window to resume work and production, and bring people's lives back to normal as transmission of the epidemic has been basically interrupted in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and nationwide, although there were still imported and sporadic local cases. Most survived businesses have been operational for nearly one month, many have not reached their full capacity yet, especially those export-oriented manufacturing companies in the coastal areas. The most serious economic recession is already a reality, even though the government organs do not want to face it for sake of their own agenda.\n \nIndia:\n India is in the midst of a strict lockdown, most companies, big and small are working from home and have found technology that will support them. Most recruitment plans are on hold until after the lockdown. Fitch rating agency warned that India GDP growth for 2020 – 2021 may stand as low as 2.1%, the lowest in 30 years.\n \nSingapore:\n All workplaces except for those providing essential services and those unable to operate remotely will be suspended from Apr 7 to May 4 during a month-long \"circuit breaker\" campaign to curb further spread of COVID-19. These measures include closing of schools and most workplaces, as well as disallowing dining in at food establishments. Singapore's crown jewel for 40 years Singapore Airlines (SIA) has been an exemplary performer and regarded as an industry leader in the aviation industry. Between 1972 to 2011, it had only one loss-making year. It has continued to be profitable - until this year. SIA had since reduced capacity by 96 per cent and grounded almost all of its fleet due to COVID-19. Most of SIA’s costs are fixed, taking a heavy toll on its cash position, even when no flights are being operated. SIA has already announced it will bolster its capital and aim to raise 15 billion Singapore Dollars from shareholders and assistance from the Singapore Government in terms of reduced or deferred fees and wage offsets, among others.\n \nNew Zealand:\n The virus forced New Zealand into full lockdown from 31st March as well as closing its borders last month, 25 days after the first case was reported.  This is the lowest number of days in the world that we are aware of and seems to be making a difference.  Tourism is New Zealand’s biggest export industry, contributing 20.4% to total exports with overseas visitors who came to New Zealand in 2019 spending the equivalent of NZ$47 million a day.  New Zealand’s national symbol is the Kiwi, which is flightless.  Quite ironic really as Covid-19 has abruptly clipped our tourism wings, and has put a virtual stop to international tourism for some time. As a result, the impact on New Zealand’s economy will be significant with huge job losses, lower accommodation prices and higher airfares to name a few. On the positive side, exports via air freight continues to gain traction requiring innovative solutions to support the New Zealand Government’s flying medical supplies into New Zealand and helping our nation’s exporters to get everything from fresh seafood, including lobster, fruit (apples, kiwifruit) as well as honey and dairy products into overseas markets with 18 international return flights operating each week to keep the supply routes open.\n \nEUROPE:\n \nThe region has suffered in unequal parts over the last few weeks, although a slowing of the curve of infections has already started.\n \nFrance:\n Government has given very little information on how and when the lockdown will cease or at least be less strict. For now, only sectors operating on the vital needs (health, food, transportation & logistics, food retail) are allowed and encouraged to work or if the company is able to operate in the secure restricted way of working for employees. For the vast majority of french people, they have been asked to stay at home and work remotely if possible, and only go out once a day for medical reasons, shopping for food or exercising ( only running is authorised) for 1 hour around 1 km at the most, starting from their home). 337 000 firms have asked for government support putting their employees on shirt-time working, representing 3,6 millions people. And lastly, this week Prime Minister said that the end of the lockdown will be complex and long, which means it will happen progressively depending on the areas and the sectors, while opening the borders will also be an issue and we have no clue so as to when will we be able to travel again.\n \nGermany:\n Germany is contemplating a major question from an European (not just EU) standpoint which is: Do we stay together and how do we support each other? Will the economically more stable countries support the weaker ones? Business opportunities will be more favorable in Germany (e.g. market entry of Chinese companies in Europe) and locally, mainly due to the lack of skilled workers post lockdown. According to what we have heard from our German contacts across segments, more contacts fear the economic issues more than the health issues. Most of the consulting business is continuing, but because there is no possibility to meet new clients face to face and there is no possibility to get new business. For the time being there is only continuation or extensions of same contracts. Despite large help programs, liquidity will be a challenge soon and some consulting companies may change focus and modify target services from advisory services to business continuity or treasury or tax or help program optimisations and corporate finance, recovery programs and restructuring. \n \nRussia:\n Our company is in self-isolation mode. Some of our clients are freezing vacancies in general but very few of our search projects have been halted.  We note some delay in projects where decision makers are in countries where quarantine regimes have been introduced. Some industries in Russia are doing fine, for instance pulp and paper industry, pharmaceuticals and food industry. In Russia, the presidential decree has extended the regime of non-working days with pay until April 30 2020.\n \nUK (United Kingdom):\n is on a 21-day lockdown. Most people expect this to be extended. UK government has announced a range of financial support for businesses and employees for the next 3 months. It is paying 80% of basic salaries for employed people that are furloughed to avoid mass unemployment. Businesses will see buying opportunities in the Financial, Retail and Real Estate sectors whilst online, internet and logistics can prosper in the “new normal” business climate.\n \nAMERICAS:\n \nThe Americas are fast becoming the new epicentre of the pandemic.\n \nUSA and Canada:\n The explosion of this corona virus was not readily obvious or not well communicated by the epidemiological experts in a way, which was readily understandable.  The sudden serious outbreak was met by a lack of preparation by the government, business and in our homes. Acceptance and response was very weak because the western leaders as well as leaders in nations adjacent to China could not fully comprehend or were being slow to react. Initially USA and Brazil also denied the serious nature of this outbreak. Economic consequences, which might have taken months to emerge in a more cyclical downturn – have happened in weeks.  Italy, Spain and other countries including Singapore for the second time are virtually standing still. Economists and other financial pundits talk about a U-shaped recovery or a V shaped recovery. However, a sustainable recovery will take time and will not be very healthy if the government and business don’t nurture it.\n \nKey Finding:\n \n \nCompanies\n are getting to grips with the “New Normal”, remote working, video conferences and evolving government business initiatives are common place globally.\n \nExecutives\n are utilising the time to enhance their skill sets with online learning. Eminent universities such as Harvard, INSEAD and Oxford to name a few, have free short online courses on a number of subjects.\n \nCompanies are reassessing\n their “routes to market”, today during the pandemic and for lengthy return to work periods thereafter\n \nNo one \n is anticipating a clear exit from this pandemic, experts say we will see shortened periods of lockdown, we will see “economic bounces” rather than a defined “V” shape recovery. Companies are planning today for the remainder of 2020 and setting plans to drive growth in Q3 and Q4.\n \n \nWe hope that you, your family and work colleagues stay healthy and safe. We at The Taplow Group are here to support you and your company through this crisis and we look forward to interacting with you again soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (4794)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Today's leaders are confronted with demands from a variety of organizational stakeholders whose needs may sometimes seem dramatically opposite. Successful leaders are those who understand these various needs and the importance of balancing them. It involves effectively doing what’s best suited for each situation, individual, or group. It’s important for you as a leader to create the right conditions for everyone to thrive — you, your team and your peers! And \n leadership development coaching\n teaches you exactly how to do that!\n\n\nWell-run, thriving organizations happen by design, not by chance. Therefore, organizations need to invest in leadership development coaching for their organizations to thrive. Leadership development coaching leads to a high-performance culture, greater customer loyalty and, ultimately, a more robust bottom line, which is a win-win situation for everyone involved.\n\n\nYour success as a leader depends on the ability to influence and work with others. Here are 5 tips that will help you maximize your learning from leadership development coaching.\n\n\n#1 Follow a Routine\n\n\n‘Routine sets you free’. This is especially true when you are looking for success. Certain habits are foundational to the success of a person and consequently sets you free from chains of struggles, worry, depression and other obstacles.\n\n\n#2 Make personal breakthroughs\n\n\nIt is crucial to operate at a higher mindset and for this, you need to engineer personal breakthroughs. How can that be achieved? By putting four specific ingredients together: commitment, courage, capacity and trust.\n\n\nCommit to a task. The commitment will feed the courage to seek out the best method to fulfil it. Each step will be a new lesson and that will help in increasing the capacity. Trust in your new knowledge and just implement it with the best strategy.\n\n\n#3 Get inspired\n\n\nYes! Setting up a goal for you is a must and should be given a priority. But how often do we find ourselves in a situation where the half-knowledge costs us more than we gained.\n\n\nIn life, it is crucial to take inspiration and advise from someone who is already an expert on the subject and can teach how to do the task systematically. One can continually expand his/her horizons and become a better leader by aiming for higher achievements in whatever goals you have set for yourself.\n\n\n#4 Be a strategist\n\n\nAs a leader, the main role you play is to lead and to provide strategy. Execution is your team’s role. However, ensuring that the strategy is executed is your duty too. Do not just plan out everything in your office cabin! Get out, get to learn the team’s shortcomings and strengths.\n\r\nThis is one of the best ways to build and lead the team, also it helps in achieving organisational goals.\n\n\n#5 Measure your growth\n\n\nWhatever you do or achieve should be displayed in key metrics. It is easier to quickly access what is going well and what needs your attention. So, when the day arrives, you have a clear picture right in front of you and it will be easier to evaluate.\n\n\nIt will help you to prioritize wisely, focus on your team and execute the strategy.\n\n\nIf you commit to practising these 5 executable ideas, it becomes simpler to enjoy the role of a leader while creating powerful results.

However, it should come as no surprise that soft skills are on a definite upswing these days. With evolving workplace-culture and changing trends, soft skills come handy both for the organisation as well as the employee.\n\n\nWhat are Soft Skills?\n\n\nSoft skills refer to the interpersonal skills that are learned outside the technical and practical training and are considered a vital addition to human capital development. It is one step ahead of the subjective education, like- personal attributes, personality traits, inherent social cues and most importantly, communication abilities. All of these factors contribute to building and maintaining healthy business relationships and for \n human capital development.\n\n\nConsultants look for soft skills along with other job skills as they allow an individual to adapt to new situations and surroundings. Enhanced soft skills make for great human capital which in turn makes for more marketable propositions, especially for the positions that are customer centric.\n\n\nHere, we present you the in-demand list of soft skills that are crucial in human capital services:\n\n\nConflict Management\n\n\nWith modern technology, diversity in work place, multi-generational workforce and an ever evolving marketplace, organizations face multi-faceted challenges- most of which involve multiple work styles, ethics and communication with multiple stakeholders that could at times cause conflicts. Human capital development should have the ability to effectively resolve a conflict with forward thinking.\n\n\nTime Management\n\n\nThe growth of business and shifting deadlines demand a healthy work and personal life balance, and it definitely requires skill. Successful management of time by human capital can go a long way in this fast-paced and booming business scenario.\n\n\nAdaptability\n\n\nBetween constant changes in processes, business structures and workloads, it is crucial under human capital development to learn to work under pressure and to move along with the flow. This is one of the most important soft skills to possess. Mental well being is a growing concern in the workplace and it is of utmost importance to possess the ability to successfully manage and adapt to stressful situations.\n\n\nCommunication\n\n\nIt is imperative to have excellent communication skills in order to succeed. Language is the only way we can communicate with people, both written and verbal. Thus, instilling diverse communication methods allow a person to be marketable across industries.\n\n\nCultural Fit\n\n\nTo augment human capital engagement, reduce human capital turnover and increase productivity, companies have been focusing on human capital development that promotes a healthy, inclusive and diverse work culture. It is the most desirable quality in the top talent.\n\n\nStrong soft skills are an indicator of a productive, collaborative and healthy work environment which is an absolute necessity for organisations in an increasingly competitive world.

This is the reason that partnering with an \nexecutive search consultant\n is one of the most preferred ways to increase awareness for the organisation among-st those who are looking for a switch.\n\n\nThe executive search consultants can speak more about your organisation in an authentic, neutral, honest way. There is no doubt that they are working for your organisation and for your benefit, but any great executive search consultant is aware that a big part of their value proposition is creating a reputation and an environment of trust and loyalty among client companies and candidates who are looking for positions in those very companies.\n\n\nIf we put the entire dialogue another way- it is a big world, but not as big as we think it to be. So, if an executive search consultant tells a person something that might turn out to be blatantly false, that person will tell this to people around him/her, his/her colleagues and so many other people. Here, the reputation of an executive search consultant is at stake. They might be labeled as being dishonest and, we all know, it is not something that we would want to be famous for.\n\n\nAs an executive search consultant, where we source C-suite leaders, we are aware that he/she is a potential client. If he/she feels misled, there is no recovering from the damage. Also, more than anything else, as an executive search consultant, it is our prime objective to get the right employee to the right company and vice versa.\n\n\nWorking with an executive search consultant strengthens your organisation with another highly important audience: the future leaders of your competitors. Well, let us tell you why:\n\n\nWith our strong networking skills we always have a pipeline ready of people looking for an opportunity. We spend considerable time gathering knowledge about them, their capabilities and their aspirations. We are also aware of the way organizations recruit. A good executive search consultant knows that his/her business model depends on following up with potential hires and building real relationships.\n\n\nWell! Earlier, building a brand required companies to do things on a big scale. Big advertising, big marketing strategies and budget.\n\n\nThis has changed!\n\n\nIn 2020, the most powerful brand-building begins with networking and real relationships.\n\n\nAs a matter of fact, partnering with The Taplow Group will help you to increase your brand awareness and reputation among a highly important audience: The leaders of your industry.\n\n\nIt is time to find the finest leader for your organisation- Go with the trusted executive search consultant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (6055)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Most industries have a pressing demand to respond to the fast-moving global economies and technological advancement to keep up!\n\n\nA slight change in the business affects its most important asset- the Human Capital. Losing an employee is a high-priced task due to the associated recruitment costs. This means that if any employee leaves the company, some of the essential and intimate knowledge base also leaves with them.\n\n\nABOUT EFFECTIVE HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT\n\n\nAn effective human capital development plan has the ability to support a smooth transition and also ensure that the employees are well prepared in advance through the change journey. It becomes crucial for the team to adapt to the new leader so that it has a minimum impact on  the workflow.\n\n\nHere are six key steps that an organisation needs to follow for effective \nhuman capital development\n:\n\n\n\n\nDefine the development clearly and align it to your business goals\n\r\n As important it is to articulate the required change, so is to conduct a critical review against organisational objectives and performance goals. This ensures that the change will carry the organisation in the right path strategically, financially, and ethically.\n\n\nRegulate the development and its impact\n\r\n Once you are clear with what exactly you wish to achieve, it becomes crucial to determine the impact of the change at various levels. Each business unit must be reviewed for the effect of how it will cascade through human capital development. This kind of information will form a blueprint to determine where training and support are needed the most to mitigate the impacts of development.\n\n\nEvolve your communication strategy\n\r\n  Each employee should be taken along on the journey of change. However, there will be few specific employees who will be highlighted in the first two steps, you absolutely must communicate the development plan to them. Communicating the change is as important as how you communicate it. The communication strategy must include a timeline for how the development will be conveyed, key information and messages, and also the communication channels and mediums you are planning to use.\n\n\nAdminister effective training\n\r\n Now, since the human capital development journey is communicated well, it is important for the employee to know that they will receive the required training- whether structured or informal, to teach the skills needed when the change is rolled out.\n\n\nImplement and measure the change process\n\r\n To build the proficiency of behaviour and technical skills, it is important to provide a support structure to assist the employee during and after the time of change. Throughout the human capital development process, a well-settled structure should be put in place to measure the impact of development. Evaluation is required to ensure continued reinforcement opportunities exist to build proficiencies; it also determines its effectiveness and documents the adaptability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (6861)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "Team Talent Development In The Workplace\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nMark Firth\n/\nThursday, February 27, 2020\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \nNo rating\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny successful business is founded on the creation of an exceptional idea- but any great idea would fail without proper execution. In the world of business, the efforts of multiple team members are required to turn an idea into reality. Without continuous \n talent development\n and power of teamwork in every area of your business, all efforts towards growth would prove futile. Innovation and execution are only possible when the entire team is working towards cumulative development.\n\n\nFortunately, improving teamwork and efforts on talent development in the workplace can be achieved by following the simple tips mentioned below:\n\n\n1.Identifying a Comprehensible High-definition Destination\n\n\nEach member of your team must be aligned with a bigger picture. It is vital for creating an environment that fosters a high level of teamwork and further enhances the impact of talent development. Your High-Definition Destination should paint a detailed picture of your business’ processes, its ecosystem, ethics & values, culture, and structure. The clarity that it will bring along is going to allow clear expectations to peep through. The team will be picture-clear with its goals, accountability, and outcomes ensuring necessary talent development.\n\n\n2.Open Communication should lead to invigoration\n\n\nNo matter how talented everyone in the team is if there is a lack of transparent communication, the chances of it being a successful team are quite low. Communication plays a crucial role in a business’s success. Passing on orders is not the definition of communication; it should mean clear-cut, open, honest and respectful expressions. The best way to make sure that communication makes its way into your every-day processes is by debriefing. Debriefing ensures for a nameless, rankless recap of the current project, and it is a great place to begin the talent development.\n\n\n3.Encourage the utilization of your resources\n\n\nA business is not just about its product/service, but the people; the real human resource who hold your business together. Every employee, regardless of their position and time they’ve been working in the company, have their skill sets, strength, and knowledge that can be an asset to others. Encouraging everyone on your team will lead to highly successful talent development. Also, this ensures that everyone will begin to work together as a team. This step is of utmost importance for team talent development. This will promote the idea of oneness and the team will resolve issues, create new ideas, and even learn new skills, which will come handy to your organization.\n\n\n4. Be a part of team-building exercises\n\n\nThere is often a learning curve for effective teamwork. Fortunately, the best way to overcome this learning curve is by creating a high-performing team. Simple team building activities will promote team talent development. These activities can be simple conference room talks, a trip to somewhere outside the organization or just ‘fun Fridays’, every little step counts. But, having said that, the communication must be focussed on experiential workshops that will help in team talent development and teach the team how to ignite innovative conversations to drive stronger collaboration. For team talent development, the team must learn to drive accountable action, leverage open planning, and must come up with ideas and processes collaboratively. This will ensure that an entirely new point of view is cultivated and the team is always enthused to work together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (5831)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\nTags: \nteam talent development \nhuman capital development \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

There are five more projects you want to do, but you pick the three that are really going to matter, and you try to do those really well, and you don’t even try to do the others.” — Sheryl Sandberg\n\n\nLeaders have umpteen demands on their limited time. As the career progresses, there is often a need for more meetings, more calls, more one-to-ones, and more areas across the business to stay on top of and drive! The list is endless. But the only thing that doesn’t change is the time on our hands. After all, there is no way to add more hours to the day, isn’t it? So how do you make work?\n\n\nAs an effective \nleader\n you need to put your time management skills into play to ensure that you maximize your time and accomplish your goals. If you are a good time manager then not only would you be able to accomplish more in less time personally but also would be able to set an example for your team on how they should spend their time and implement a few time-saving methods that will win them the most results!\n\n\nThe key to successful time management is to be proactive and purposeful about your day, every day! Here’s how you can manage your time like a pro every day.\n\n\nPlan realistically and prioritize\n\n\nPriorities help you set your day in motion. Plan in advance on what work you would tackle first, and what can wait. Remember, it’s not about how many hours you have, it’s how you use them!\n\n\nDelegate\n\n\nWhile you might have the skills to do anything, you need to understand that you may not be able to do everything due to paucity of time. As a leader, you must know which tasks can be delegated to other team members so that you can give your full attention to high priority tasks and the things only you can do. Sounds easy, right?\n\n\nMake to-do lists\n\n\nAdopt the habit of writing things down and scheduling out your workflow. It would not only allow you to see how much you’re actually trying to accomplish but also give you an insight into if you are under or overdoing it! Making a to-do list would also help you to check how many times do you get derailed by an unexpected meeting or an email that requires immediate action.\n\n\nDecline unproductive meetings\n\n\nAsk yourself if you really need to be in all those meetings? If the answer is no then declined them? Go through your schedule and look at what you need to do your best quality work with the time you have on hand.\n\n\nThe key is to balance out what you can do effectively and what you need to delegate. Remember, great leaders don’t just happen; they take the time to be great!\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, through our executive search services, we help you source leaders who are adept at leading by example and not merely by their words.

Why?\n\n\nIt does not matter whether you have conducted the search for an executive internally or externally. The rule holds that the executive search will not be a great success as you expect it to be unless the organization is ready to invest in the kind of expertise required to find the right talent.\n\n\nFor an \n executive search\n to be a success, it must match force with the explosion in the amount of data available on various industries, executives and companies.\n\n\nThis is the reason companies are looking out for an Executive Search consultant to help them find the right talent. We have listed out few issues that arise while searching for the right candidate the traditional way:\n\n\nInternet is a forest of information\n\n\nThe data is scattered on the internet and simply looking for senior executives on a search engine is not the greatest idea. A great deal of valuable information is tucked away in the databases that are not even visible to a giant like ‘Google’.\n\n\nRight Mix of Traditional and Modern search\n\n\nIf we put aside the wonders of LinkedIn, most senior executive searches have not changed in more than 50 years. Internal recruiters are still looking for candidates in a traditional manner, which is like searching for a proverbial needle in the haystack. And, the haystack resembles Mount Everest due to the availability of so much data.\n\n\nA great search firm like The Taplow Group, has adopted modern methods which traditional firms might overlook while standing in plain sight. With the amount of data available, we have to find a way to dig straight to the right candidate and make the executive search process successful one.\n\n\nHaving said that, the manual and the traditional work of executive search remain the same- the lugging and heaving required to determine if the candidate is qualified and whether he/she has the required skills to make your organization flourish.\n\n\nNot enough networking\n\n\nThe more channels and methods of communication, the merrier. To manage the onslaught of data and technology, it is important that a team is always active on different platforms. Social networking applications and Emails are the biggest platforms to connect with a prospective candidate and begin the executive search process.\n\n\nIt is crucial to get onboard with various means of communication and if not, there is always a risk of getting left behind in the process of executive search.\n\n\nRelying completely on outdated ‘Best Practices’\n\n\nThe widely accepted executive search ‘best practices’ were introduced before there was the internet and it has changed a little. Candidate identification has gone through a major change. Technology has made advancements since then. Executive search research- which is also called ‘sourcing’, began as a secretarial chore. Where candidate data was organized, identified, developed and then the recruitment process took place.\n\n\nThe biggest problem with the traditional way of executive search is its obsession with assembling lists of candidates. This is not helpful, especially now. With diversity in the work culture and different requirements, a candidate doesn’t have to just look good on the profile but should hold the accountability of an all-rounder. Just hoarding the information of the candidate is not a guarantee of a successful executive search. It is important to keep pace with technological advancement and leverage its qualities.\n\n\nBig Responsibility requires Big Expertise\n\n\nA serious research will transform data into an actionable intelligence. The entire process of research speeds up the time to hire and increases the quality of every hire. Executive search is the kind of work that cannot be handed off to just any employee in the organization.\n\n\nThe executive search requires to have passion for information science, data mining, competitive intelligence and knack for investigation. A great executive search firm will ensure you have the right senior executive to manage your organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (5544)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\nTags: \nexecutive search consultant \nexecutive search services \nexecutive search USA \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

In the discourse, we often find ourselves asking a lot of questions- How well is it going? Is there a problem? How are we supposed to do better? and so on. But, how often do we turn that inquisitive mind towards ourselves, and ask those probing questions which might assist for leadership development?\n\n\nHere is a list of questions that great leaders should ask daily to help them in their \n leadership development.\n\n\nHow accountable am I?\n\n\nCulture of accountability should begin at the top. The leader defines the culture, so, he/she must show accountability if he/she wants others to follow the suit.\n\n\nHow engaged and excited am I?\n\n\nEnthusiasm is infectious, so as a leader, one must be engaged in their duty and work while being enthused. This attitude is great for leadership development and creates engaged and excited teams.\n\n\nHow often do I listen to my team?\n\n\nListening is a sign that you show respect and you value your team’s opinion. This also helps augment the team’s involvement which automatically increases their commitment and adds to your leadership development.\n\n\nHow open am I to feedback?\n\n\nFeedback is the breakfast of the champions and an important element for leadership development. It helps in the overall development of the team and ensures better engagement.\n\n\nHow can I improve the quality of the feedback?\n\n\nThe way you communicate the feedback will determine how effectively it is used or not. It is much better to provide feed-forward and give insight and suggestions on how to improve in the future.\n\n\nHow much support do I provide to my team?\n\n\nEnsuring that the team has the right support is one way to put them into a winning position and encourage them to think collectively for the growth of the entire organization. Providing support ensures constant growth in leadership development.\n\n\nHow can I make my team better?\n\n\nWorking towards the overall development of the team nurtures their capabilities to increase engagement, retention and results.\n\n\nAm I a good role model for my team?\n\n\nIt is crucial to exhibit the same behavior as you want to see from your team. Be a good example for your team to follow. As a leadership duty, the entire team look up to you for guidance and often model what they see. So, it becomes all the way more important to act responsibly.\n\n\nHow can I be a better leader?\n\n\nEven the greatest of the leaders know that there is always a little room for improvement. It is important to engage in activities that will help in your overall leadership development, like- reading books on leadership qualities, watching people speak of their experience and observing great leaders and their work ethics, etc.\n\n\nAs a part of leadership development, we should not just challenge those around us to be better, but need to challenge ourselves by asking these questions daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (5952)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\nTags: \nleadership development \nleadership consulting \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

But, a successful team is not just that. Building up a strong team and for \n leadership development\n, it requires an equally strong and driven leader. Without a good and dedicated leader, the team is most likely to not function to its full potential.\n\n\nLeadership development is mostly about leaders helping themselves and their team members to do the right thing, set directions, have an inspiring vision and just be innovative at every step. Leaders are responsible for driving the entire team towards the ‘win’.\n\n\nAs a leader, your vision of a team must be clear and here is how you can realize your vision of creating a great team:\n\n\nCreate a blueprint\n\n\nAn effective team is not just accumulating the best talent. Until a certain level it is true that hiring the right kind of people is the most crucial part of building a great team, but, delegating a task to the right person provides a team member more autonomy and motivates them to work harder. This is where leadership development takes a front seat.\n\n\nHowever, managing a team is not as simple as it may sound. Leaders have to play a more hands-on role to make sure the team is properly functioning. Planning everything ahead and prioritizing the tasks makes them less hectic and helps the team to move forward smoothly towards achieving their goals.\n\n\nIt is also crucial to line-up each goal carefully for maximum effect. Because even the slightest miscalculation can take the entire team off-course over time.\n\n\nCreate your team’s culture\n\n\nA group of people working together develops a culture of their own. As a part of leadership development, you have the power to decide which behaviors to encourage and discourage. Remember, with great power comes great responsibility!\n\n\nAs a leader, you need to ensure that the team works well with each other. Also, you need to look for opportunities to set-up guidelines for how people will work together.\n\n\nSet the tone of organizational work-culture\n\n\nAlways remember, if your team members feel that they are not being respected, it is a drawback in your leadership development and the team won’t be motivated to bring their best ideas forward. Not being trusted is the biggest hindrance in an employee’s performance.\n\n\nThe untrusting environment implies that employees will always think twice before sharing their out-of-box ideas, out of fear of it being dismissed.\n\n\nSo, it is incredibly important for leaders to set a tone and a model of behavior for everyone to respect each other and encourage each other at the organizational level.\n\n\nTake accountability\n\n\nEvery company must discuss the culture of accountability explicitly early on. As a leader, the biggest strength of ongoing leadership development is that you hold everyone accountable for their action and work, including your own self.\n\n\nWorking as a team, sometimes people tend to place the blame on to the next person rather than taking the accountability of it. If you want to be acknowledged for all the hard work, as a part of leadership development it is equally important to take account of any mistake.\n\n\nWith the right kind of communication, it becomes easier for an employee to own-up his or her mistake and they would definitely try to make amendments for the same.\n\n\nSet Expectations for Feedback\n\n\nHow often you give feedback is as important as how you deliver it to the concerned person. Usually, an organization where there is a tradition of providing frequent feedback (good or bad), employees are not so alarmed when they receive criticism. In fact, they are more open to listening and acting upon it\n\n\nDelayed feedback can have a corrosive effect on the work environment.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, through our professional search services, we help you source great leaders who have a proven record of creating winning teams.

As a flexible leader, one can modify their style or approach to leadership in response to uncertain, unpredictable or unforeseen circumstances and emerge a winner. In addition to this, a flexible leader can adapt to changes as they come. For example, if they are flexible it doesn’t take much of their time to revise their plans while still on track to achieve their goals. Flexibility not only allows a leader to survive and thrive in various situations but also enables them to incorporate new innovations and overcome challenges in a timely manner. On the other hand, adaptable leaders are also much sought after for their ability to implement new behaviors into old, existing situations. This enables them to express creativity in their work and find new ways to solve old problems.\n\n\nBeing an adaptive leader to meet the needs of a changing business environment, the needs of different team members, and a variety of opportunities, is definitely more effective than being bound by and staying in the comfort zone of a single leadership style.\n\n\nHere’s how you can build a flexible and adaptive mindset\n\n\nKnow when to bend the rules\n\n\nAre you a stickler for standard operating procedures? When was the last time you brought about a change in a process? Try and do something different once in a while.\n\n\nThink before you say no\n\n\nWhat’s your first reaction when a team member suggests something innovative or path-breaking? Don’t say no to everything. Think the idea through and see its merits.\n\n\nBe an early adopter\n\n\nDon’t resist change instead embrace it. Find out how new technology, system, tool, software, or process is relevant to you and your organization. Learn it and then teach it to your team members.\n\n\nAcknowledge the strengths and weaknesses of your team members\n\n\nInvest in your team. Delegate work according to their skills and interests. And when you hire new team members, try and fill the existing gaps in knowledge and competencies.\n\n\nTo be an effective leader, one has to learn to balance being flexible and adaptable. You should know how to go with the flow without losing direction, moving your organization forward with resilience and alertness.

    "content": "How To Raise Your Leadership Game In 2020\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nMark Firth\n/\nFriday, December 27, 2019\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to be a great and effective leader, one needs to be very clear on their vision, and actions one may need to take to turn their vision into a reality. At times there may arise a need for one to look inwards and focus on their own abilities and shortcomings, and ask themselves how can they find ways to empower and inspire their team. In many ways a New Year means a fresh start. Here are some ways to turn the conversation inward and focus on developing leadership skills to up your leadership game in the coming year.\n\n\nMake your Passion Infectious\n\n\nYou have been able to scale great professional heights by being passionate. Now is the time to use that passion to motivate others. There can be no greater motivation for your team than to see you display authentic enthusiasm and passion for achieving organizational excellence like never before!\n\n\nAdmit when you err\n\n\nEveryone makes mistakes including the most powerful and inspiring leaders. The key to great leadership is admitting your mistake as soon as you recognize it and take corrective action.\n\n\nWork on your Strengths\n\n\nHow about starting the New Year with a detailed analysis of your strengths and weaknesses and then making a plan to overcome your weaknesses and further strengthen your strong virtues?\n\n\nMotivate your Team\n\n\nMotivation stems from belief. Believe in your team’s ability and inspire them. A team who thinks that their leader does not believe in them is bound to fail. As a leader, you must motivate them to work harder and reach great heights. Even when things don’t go according to the plan, keep your cool, take charge and work on things with your team to bring them on track. Remember there is nothing like a leader who can walk the talk!\n\n\nFocus on Bettering Yourself\n\n\nRaise the bar for yourself. Ask yourself how can you do better than the previous year. Chalk out a plan which may prompt you to set higher targets on some of your most strategic goals. Show respect to your team members by asking them for their input and ideas. Listen to them. And most importantly, value your team members by implementing their good ideas and rewarding them for it.\n\r\nWe hope you will make these resolutions a part of your personal leadership development plan in 2020 and watch your team soar! Happy New Year!\n\r\nAt The Taplow Group, through our professional search, we help you source leaders who can help you transform your organization and scale greater heights.

Technology can be a blessing, but it can also be a threat, as it also is leverage for power — such as water or food — in the hands of national or international rogue communities. This is the truer in a world where technology has made accountability an increasingly elusive objective. As such, Technology has then become a political goal per se. \n\n\n“Whoever becomes the leader in [Artificial Intelligence] will become the ruler of the world.”\r\n— Vladimir Putin, President of Russia\r\n\n\n\nBut current efforts to reduce the global management of technology to a mere rearrangement of the global supply chain are showing a dangerous backfiring, e.g. by harming those businesses whose financial performance was meant to be protected originally, by spurring techno-nationalisms which might even contribute to the rise of competitive industries in non-democratic countries, or even more so by creating a global political turmoil that forces our businesses to leave countries.\n\n\n“We are locked in a race with countries such as China and Russia to be the first to deploy 5G.”\n\n\n\r\n\t— Meredith Attwell Baker, President & CEO US Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association\r\n\n\n\nOther governments are reducing the management of technology to a matter of infrastructure security, failing to see the underlying political clash between democracies and autocracies.\n\n\n\r\n\t“Avoiding damage to national sovereignty” is an important consideration of European countries’ negotiations with China over technology — Emmanuel Macron, President of France\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\tBecause of such a short-term view of technology as a strategic asset, western businesses and countries are losing ground against China.\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\tThe conflict between the US and China “should worry the US most of all, because, unlike China, it lacks a long-term strategic framework.”\n\r\n— Stephen S. Roach, Yale University and former Chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\tIn a world where technology has become a major geopolitical power play, I propose a new perspective on its governance, one in which it has become imperative that industry strategists, corporate government affairs departments as well as policymakers understand technology and how it is impacting the international political environment well beyond tactical trading and digital infrastructure activities.\r\n\n\n\nLooking Beyond Mere Trading\n\n\n\r\n\tThe 19th century emphasized the stabilizing nature of economics, and this subsequently marked all of the 20th century. As a result, whoever managed the economy, managed politics. The relationship between economics and politics was clear, up to the point of confirming the discipline of political economy as \"the study of production and trade and their relations with law, custom and government\"; when applied to the international landscape, it is referred to as international political economy. During that time, the only evolution in this wave of thought was about how should the economy be managed (c.f. \"Political power follows economic power\", The Economist 2016); should it be the state, or should it be left up to the market? The interrelation between economy and politics was clear, and the international political economy became the cornerstone of policymaking and of international relations.\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\tToday though, it is technology which builds our lives. Amnesty International just asserted that the current debate about the role of social media in managing fake news is inherently a breach of human rights. Russia is running a massive disinformation campaign in African countries. And in response to public outcries, Iran shut off internet access for its citizens. Not to mention the permanent privacy breaches or the persecution of Uighurs.\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\tTechnology also takes media by storm. During a recent speech, Marc Zuckerberg called social media the “Fifth Estate”, as a way to give people a voice. Such a comparison triggered a heated debate, both among technologists and lawmakers about the role of social media in free speech and national politics.\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\tThe economy is also impacted by technology. This past summer, Yanis Varoufakis proposed that the IMF takes over Libra as a digital token to “reduce global trade imbalances and rebalance financial flows” and “help the IMF fulfil its original purpose” by turning the IMF into “a global sovereign wealth fund” for transnational currency exchanges.\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\tTechnology even shifts the international balance of power. David Marcus gave last month a geopolitical twist to the lack of support by western regulators and governments to Facebook’s Libra project. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for a common stance from European countries regarding the involvement of Chinese vendors in 5G deployments. Not to mention Xi Jinping's Digital Silk Road.\r\n\n\n\nUN secretary-general António Guterres summed it all up in a video interview this week by explaining how technology is the major consideration today in explaining the social and geostrategic divides. International political economy alone, as a field of study that tries to explain the changes in our society and international relations, has become outdated. We need to bring technology in.\n\n\nTechnology has been lowering the barriers of entry in politics, as it has been doing for some time with most legacy industries, wrongly branding such an impact as 'technology disruption'. From the role of hyper connectivity in the development of countries, to the impact and role of social media in our lives and communities, the brutal changes in national and foreign participations in our democracies, the obsolescence of previous concepts about warfare, the role of our own governments, and the need for a more humanised AI, the choices we and our named politicians make about technology reflect our own values, both personal and in political theory. And so, we need a fundamentally different approach to address these differences in values.\n\n\nA \"Gulf of Mutual Incomprehension\"\n\n\n\r\n\tNow, the biggest hurdle to make these changes is the lack of understanding of technology by our policymakers. I took it from Bruce Schneier (Fellow and Lecturer, Harvard Kennedy School) how it was the British scientist CP Snow who already pointed out in 1959 in his book The Two Cultures that there is a breakdown of communication between scientists and humanities (a miscommunication that was later satirised by comedians Flanders and Swann). A sixty years gap has not bridged in the \"gulf of mutual incomprehension\" between today's technologists and policymakers. As Schneier said, more than the interesting societal observation that it was in 1959, the miscommunication is a full crisis today, as it deprives policymakers of an adequate preparation for managing today's world.\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\tIndeed, policymakers do not understand technology or the importance it should have in their mandates. The US Congressional Office of Technology Assessment closed in 1995, to reopen just recently; 24 years of lack of assessment in technology. So no surprise that US congressmen showed a blatant ignorance during the hearings of the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal. Trump response to China's 5G leadership reflects his understanding of foreign affairs based on trade balance (the same way of thinking that has lead him to repeatedly question since he was elected in 2016 the US military support to South Korea); meanwhile, China country uses its technological leadership to sway the outcome of the incoming Taiwanese elections in its favour or to boost the collaboration with Russia, and it continues to develop its Digital Belt and Road initiative. Trump also recently showed a deep lack of understanding of his own country telecoms market, when he recently asked Tim Cook to help get the US ready for 5G (Apple is not a main actor in deploying 5G). And in Europe, the debate about 5G among policymakers has been merely reduced to a question of infrastructure security, whereas it is gobsmacking to believe that infrastructure breaches can all be remedied, while the debate actually is about trust, democracies versus autocracies.\r\n\n\n\nThe Impact on Corporations\n\n\nHarvard history professor Niall Ferguson made the case that in July 1914, bond markets in London were still acting as if war was not imminent. His point was to show how tough it is for companies to plan on the unthinkable when \"business as usual\" is the safest professional bet one can make.\n\n\nStill, country managers 'just' keep up with events taking place in their countries and in their corporation home country, analysing the effect on foreign exchange rates. It's only natural though. People are rewarded and promoted for making things happen, not for expressing doubt and advising caution in the face of slow-burning threats. So, they go for more pragmatic and action-oriented strategies, rather than a reflective and diplomatic approach. But this approach routinely leaves them without the deep understanding required to interpret political developments within and across societies: their customers.\n\n\nLobbying is the most generalised way of handling uncertainty in \"business as usual\". The technology industry is no alien to it, having generated an impressive increase in lobbying. Mark Zuckerberg just recently apparently privately recommended several potential hires to the presidential campaign of Pete Buttigieg’s — the rising Iowa caucus State Democrat star who has proved to be a major competitor of Joe Biden and Elisabeth Warren; two of the people recommended were hired. Not to mention Tim Cook's courting on Trump.\n\n\n\r\n\tSometimes lobbying is just not enough to keep \"business as usual\" though, and the geopolitical weather triggers strategic corporate actions. As it happens, the RISC-V Foundation — a hardware company which directs the development of an open-source instruction set architecture for CPUs, and whose members include Alibaba, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Western Digital, NXP, Google, Huawei, IBM, MediaTek, Nokia and Red Hat —decided this week to incorporate in Switzerland instead of Delaware US, where it used to be based; the notion that the US is no longer the best location for some companies could have far-reaching consequences.\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\tGeopolitical events affect companies' strategies whatever their location, sector or size. How geopolitics affect fortune 500 corporations might seem obvious, but there are many more companies that are now actively linked into the rest of the globe because of the process of globalization (even if some analysts say that globalisation is dying). Geopolitics can teach businesses to pick up on “weak signals” that could point to future problems in a country; Jay Ogilvy once said: \"To ignore geopolitical forecasting is like ignoring the weather forecast before setting off on a picnic\".\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\tHaving become such a fundamental pillar of politics, it is imperative that not just governments but also investors and the boards of directors start considering the relationship between technology and politics.\r\n\n\n\nSummary & Call to Action\n\n\nTechnology is creating our future. Technology can be a blessing, but it can also be a threat, as it also is a leverage for power — such as water or food — in the hands of national or international rogue communities. This is the truer in a world where technology, actually, has made accountability an increasingly elusive objective.\n\n\nTechnology has then become a political goal per se. But current efforts to reduce the global management of technology to a mere rearrangement of the global supply chain are showing a dangerous backfiring, e.g. by harming those businesses whose financial performance was meant to be protected originally, by spurring techno-nationalisms which might even contribute to the rise of competitive industries in non-democratic countries, or even more so by creating a global political turmoil that forces our businesses to leave our country. Other governments are reducing the management of technology to a matter of infrastructure security, failing to see the underlying political clash between democracies and autocracies.\n\n\nIt has then become imperative that industry strategists, corporate government affairs departments and policymakers understand technology. But there has traditionally been a “gulf of mutual incomprehension\" between technologists and policymakers. There has even been a certain class proudness in neglecting each other. A rejection that shows no signs of decreasing, with policymakers pushing aside every technology trend into the digital transformation basket. This miscommunication has transformed into a full crisis today, as it deprives policymakers of an adequate preparation for managing today's technology world.\n\n\nThe case for corporate and business strategy and government affairs departments, as well as public policymakers, to think about technology beyond intellectual property, trading or digital transformation — and to surround themselves by politics-minded technologists — is clear. Technology should be an essential component of corporate strategies and country public policies. Political power follows economic power, they say. Political power also now follows technology power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: Carlos Ruiz Gomez, \n Telecommunications & Emerging Technologies | Madrid, London & Brussels\r\n \n\n\n \r\nLinkedIn:\n https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlosruiz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (5368)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "Telecom Service Providers and Data Governance in Connected Industries\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nMark Firth\n/\nThursday, December 26, 2019\n/\nCategories: \nNews\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTelco carriers have since long fought not to become just 'dumb pipes'. For this, they came up, back in 2012, with the term ' digital telco' meaning the one telco operator wishing to deliver services beyond pure good old commoditised connectivity, at some point time adding up a security component (hence the past success with MPLS and VPNs).\n\n\nDuring my professional career, I assisted in the birth of many of the first digital telcos globally, and worked with, probably, one of the very firsts: Telefónica Digital. Indeed, the Spanish telco giant started offering cloud services back in 2010, only to clash with planetary cloud service providers, and realise that telcos simply don't have the scale to compete with the AWS, Azure, Google Cloud... Sometimes, these digital telcos even experimented with 'industrialised' services and new marketplace-based organisations aimed at SMBs, as a way to become more agile, and come closer to these hyperscalers; the experiments were short-lived though. In the end, the digital telcos capitulated and opted for a co-opetition model with the cloud hyperscalers (in between, Huawei-based white label clouds became a very interesting subject, but this is far out of the scope of this short article).\n\n\nDigital telcos soon also started experimenting with M2M (now part of their broader IoT portfolio), initially more a product than a service (later, the cloud hyperscalers again were much more successful in converting IoT into services). Soon, more industry-specific value propositions were added to their portfolios. So even if telcos had issues monetising their M2M propositions at large scale, at least the effort allowed digital telcos to start experimenting with vertical portfolios, ending up in the creation of industry verticals e.g. in healthcare (I directly witnessed the birth of Telefónica's Competence Centres), an organisational structure that still essentially lives up to this day.\n\n\nEven with individual enterprise vertical propositions though, these digital telcos had limited success, mainly because their sales and marketing organisations were not prepared to manage a series of new services which weighed so much less than the long-lived traditional connectivity services in the variable OTE of their connectivity-savvy account managers, resulting in meagre 'digital' corporate financial results.\n\n\nAs a result of the portfolio verticalization, telcos gladly embraced the 'digital transformation' wave, as an extra source of revenues in the B2B segment. But ' digital transformation' still relegated telcos to the role of mere technology providers, and not even a really differentiating one as they faced themselves competing with Cloud Service Providers and Global System Integrators (GSIs). True, telcos still had strategic assets that others didn't: their networks and wireless spectrum; but telcos have been in a rush for outsourcing the management and even the ownership of their mobile masts to third parties (either independent 'towercos' like Cellnex, or creating new ad hoc companies, like Telxius) in an effort to reduce OPEX, and even the telcos' exclusivity in buying and managing spectrum could be at stake now, with the advent of private spectrum auctions directly to enterprises.\n\n\nIn the consumer segment (B2C), Telco’s are also starting to capitulate in favour of Over-The-Top (OTT) providers like Netflix or Apple (which is betting big time on services), and are betting on becoming service platforms, rather than 'inventing' these services.\n\n\nSo despite some success, telco service providers have still not been able to woo away the threat of the 'dump pipe' — a digital one, but a 'dumb pipe' nevertheless — and the question about their future remains a valid one. But Telco’s still keep another asset: the access to customers, and therefore to their data, even if they face, again, dark clouds, with the increasing adoption of eSIMs. And I believe that the management of this customer touchpoint is one that telcos should be able to effectively leverage in order to woo away the threat of the ' digital dump pipe' and to elevate their role as a peer, and not just a supplier, to other industries.\n\n\nTake the example of the Automotive industry. Of all the novelties in the horizon of the legacy automakers (electric batteries, self-driving, mobility services ...), it is the connected car which has the key for their survivability.\n\n\nIndeed, automakers know (or should know) that their traditional industry business model will have to transform from one based on the one-off sale of an asset (the car) to the future owner to one based on a new, continuous relationship with the driver and with all the vehicle occupants. This means that, if automakers want to survive, they will need to transform into service providers. That is the same type of relationship that the telco service providers have with their subscribers. Therefore, we find ourselves with a scenario in which two service providers confront, compete with each other for the relationship with the end customer, a relationship which is somehow reminiscent of the clash between telco service providers and the over-the-top service providers.\n\n\nBut automakers have limited the role of telcos as mere suppliers of analytics solutions (the big data hype). I argue that this is a conscious, defensive yet legitimate move by automakers, aimed at protecting their role in their own industry by neutralising the telco service providers and relegating the later to another ' digital transformation' brick. Indeed, it should not be taken for granted that automakers are the owners of the data generated in the cars (and even MEPs at the European Commission have pronounced themselves in this respect). Telco service providers should fight back such attempted irrelevance and defend their 'share' of in-car consumer data (eventually, auto and telco service providers would also have to deal with other actors for the control of the user, e.g. fleet management companies).\n\n\nSmart cities are yet another example worth examining. And, as the case of the Toronto Quayside and Hudson Yards in New York projects has shown over and over, for the sake of this article, smart cities are a more evolved and clearer example than automakers. Indeed, if these projects have shown us that it's about the battle for the data that is generated by citizens. It's a more complex example of the connected car with a higher number of third parties involved, mainly the municipalities. In this case, though, the collective nature of smart cities offers a new set of problems when it comes to data ownership and protections, the local public administration seemingly emerges as the natural option for city dwellers would subsidise the management of their data. Beyond automotive and smart cities, telecom service providers can position themselves as equals to every other industry, not just ' digital transformation' suppliers: it is not that much about technology, as about the customer. And they should do so by analysing the evolution of the type and source of the data that those other industries generate as of today, compared to their future possibilities as service providers.\n\n\nMore than playing the digital transformation hand, telco service providers should have a very active role in all those industries where incumbents face themselves to their transformation into service providers. But more than fighting for these new alternate service providers, such a role should be about jointly facilitating the governance of the data. Think city data governance frameworks, Sidewalk Labs' Digital Transparency in the Public Realm (DTPR) language, and Tim Berners-Lee's very recent Contract for the Web. This is the league where telco service providers should be playing in, to woo away the 'dump pipe' — 'analogue' or 'digital' — ghost.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: Carlos Ruiz Gomez, \n Telecommunications & Emerging Technologies | Madrid, London & Brussels\n\n\nLinkedIn: \n https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlosruiz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (4093)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

If an organization wants to get ahead of the competition, then it needs to hire the best talent in the market to help it get there.\n\n\nBut how does one source the best talent? Is there a sure-shot way of getting what you seek? In today’s competitive job market, top talent is not so readily available and you need the help of experts to reach out to them and that expertise is available to you in the form of a professional search firm.\n\n\nA professional search firm will help you search for and engage with the qualified talent to fill your organization's current or future positions. Do you know that according to recent research, only 36 percent of the current workforce is actively looking for a new opportunity at any given time, but an astonishing 90 percent is willing to talk and learn more.\n\n\nEngaging with a professional search firm opens up a huge talent pool for organizations, which they didn’t have access to before. This pool contains both passive, and active candidates who otherwise wouldn't apply because they didn’t know about the organization or open opportunities available. It also allows organizations to take control of their pipeline and initiate conversations with the talent they really want to hire.\n\n\nThe cost of a bad hire is manifold. Many organizations use the services of professional search firms to essentially avoid the cost of a bad hire. Professional search firms use a range of personal contacts in their industry, as well as their in-depth knowledge of the industry, to find suitable candidates for their clients. They conduct detailed interviews and then selectively present candidates to their clients.\n\n\nThey also help clients draft accurate and enticing job descriptions to draw in a pool of qualified candidates. Most organizations that decide to use a professional search firm do so because they don't have the internal resources, network, or perhaps even suitable skills to hire themselves. At times, some organizations may even seek their help to hire from competitors indirectly, allowing them to find candidates they might not have been able to find otherwise.\n\n\nQuite a number of professional search firms also engage with their client organizations for cultural & leadership assessment, strategy deployment, and other talent advisory services.

    "content": "4 Ways To Get Most Out Of Your Leadership Development Coach\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nMark Firth\n/\nMonday, December 23, 2019\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoaching is a crucial step in the journey of leadership development. It evokes reflection and self-awareness and helps leaders define the career path they want to embark upon. This further encourages them to achieve their goals in the long run.\n\n\nLeadership development is an important exercise and a coach plays a very important role in it. Your leadership development coach would help you to identify development gaps and spot opportunities that are in tandem with your chosen career path. Coaching enables you to achieve what is important to you in the real sense. Using various tools like conversations and powerful questioning, your leadership development coach can help you achieve your goals faster than you could do it if you were doing it all on your own.\n\n\nHere are the 4 things you could do, to get the most out of your leadership development coach.\n\n\nMake time for it\n – Make your leadership development activity your priority. You need to fit it in your timetable in order to get results that you seek. You will need to become more strategic with your time and make your leadership coaching consistent and result oriented in the long run.\n\n\nMake the effort\n – Make a list of what all would you like to accomplish and then work towards achieving those things. Leadership development coaching is very different from other learning and development exercises. Here you are in charge of defining your own learning objectives, planning session agendas and putting together the coaching schedule. This is completely your show, and you are the one who needs to take charge of it!\n\n\nAccept feedback\n – Taking feedback is an important aspect of your leadership development journey. Your coach will regularly give you feedback on how you could improve as a leader. Apart from the coach you could also solicit feedback from the people you work with and for. Always remember, feedback is a gift, whether good or critical.\n\n\nOne small step at a time\n – Remember, Rome was not built in a day. There would be challenges on the road to leadership coaching. And the key to achieving results is to keep moving forward even if it means just taking one small step at a time. For example, your leadership development coach may ask you to experiment with a new skill or have a difficult conversation with someone. Take every single step as a progress.\n\n\nThe hallmark of a great leadership development coach is that he/she would challenge you, encourage you, confront you, affirm you and provoke you. The end goal of your coach would always be your growth, evolution, and development as a leader and a person.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, through our professional search, we help you source leaders who have a proven track record of successful leadership to help your organization become even more successful.To know more about our services like leadership consulting, professional hiring, management consulting, visit  \nwww.TaplowGroup.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (6362)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

This is the sole reason why effective talent acquisition becomes extremely important. Focus is the major difference between acquiring talent and simply recruiting. Recruiting is just about here and now, whereas Talent Acquisition takes a long-term view, which means that everything, right from skills to future development to cultural fit is considered before the final offer is made. Therefore, to streamline the entire talent acquisition process, many organizations choose to partner with executive search firms to help them find the best talent.\n\n\nSo, how do executive search firms ensure that they play a fair game, by acquiring the kind of talent their partner organization is looking to hire rather than simply getting someone into an open position to do the job?\n\n\nToday's complex business atmosphere demands that businesses always work to the highest professional and ethical standards and establish trust by being honest and responsible. And just like any other business, ethics are extremely important in executive search firms as well.\n\n\nEthical practices help not only to maintain a great reputation but also mitigate significant financial and legal issues.\n\n\nIn order to be successful at executive search, one must follow certain ground rules:\n\n\na. Confidentiality – There is a lot of information that’s shared between a candidate and the executive search firm. One should never pass on the information without authorization from the candidate as it can create a very negative impression on the potential candidate’s mind regarding the business practices if the executive search firm.\n\n\nb. Integrity – The executive search business must be conducted with integrity at all times which means no deceptive and misleading practices.\n\n\nc. Loyalty – One must stay loyal to one’s partner organizations and protect their interests.\n\n\nd. Competence – Staff must be competent and dedicated to find the best fit.\n\n\ne. Validated search processes – There shouldn’t be any shortcuts in the entire hiring process as a bad hire can cost twice as much. Candidate evaluation is an important step in the entire process. One should never push the candidates for interviews with the organizations without screening assessment and due diligence.\n\n\nf. Disclosures and waivers – All disclosures and waivers must be in place so that there is no conflict of interest.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, we ensure that we fulfill all our commitments and maintain high standards of responsibility towards our partner organizations at all times.

    "content": "The Good to Great of Being a Leader\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nMark Firth\n/\nTuesday, November 26, 2019\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether you are heading a small company with a few employees or a bigger organization with substantial staff, strong leadership skills can make all the difference between a successful business and a dwindling one.\n\n\nSo, what is it that sets the successful leaders apart from the others?\n\n\nHere are 4 traits that make a world of a difference in how leadership is approached by leaders of different statures.\n\n\n1. Great leaders focus on improving themselves at all times\n\n\nLeadership development is an important aspect of great leadership. Effective leaders possess the right mindset, leadership skills, and behaviors to make their organizations successful. But of course, the best way to engage leaders and develop them for success is through targeted leadership development programs. These leadership development sessions include a variety of tools and techniques including assessments, simulations, deep skill practice, coaching, and activities.\n\r\n \n\n\n2. Great leaders welcome feedback\n\n\nTo be successful, it is important for one to realize their own strengths and weaknesses, and for leaders, criticism, and praise come hand in hand. It is easier to surround oneself with sycophants who would never challenge your acts or decisions or push back. However, great leaders would always have a trusted circle of family and friends who would give them honest feedback on both the right and wrong of their acts and great leaders would work towards their areas of development by first acknowledging that there is scope for improvement even for them.\n\n\n3. Great leaders welcome responsibility\n\n\nNothing ever can explain this concept better than the famous line from the movie Spiderman \"With great power comes great responsibility\". Over the years it may have acquired the status of a leadership cliché but the essence of the statement hasn’t diluted even one bit. As a leader one needs to understand that the ultimate responsibility lies with them and if something goes wrong then they need to own it up.\n\n\n4. Great leaders build others\n\n\nThe easiest thing to do in life is torn other people down, and believe it or not, in the kind of world that we are living in today this is a major occurrence. On the other hand, great leaders are more focused on becoming a positive influence on their people’s lives. However, this in no way means that they are people pleasers and have nothing bad to say to or about anyone. What it essentially implies is that they give constructive or meaningful feedback to realize the full potential of their people. Leadership isn't just about being charismatic or having the ability to take charge of a room or a charming personality. It's more to do with a person's character and core traits.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, through our professional search, we help you source leaders who have a proven track record of pushing past their limits and realizing their true potential.

In situations like these, one needs to keep their calm, pay greater attention to what needs to be corrected and be your own biggest critic.\n\n\nIdentify what requires a change\n\n\nDo what you would do to your team members, i.e. identify your strengths and weaknesses, see what requires improvement. Ponder on your actions and see where you're going wrong.\n\n\nPut in the effort required\n\n\nAwareness is half the battle won!. Real progress and improvement can be seen when an effort is made to further work on the findings. For you to successfully break through your limitations, and truly be a phenomenal leader, you need to analyze your complete belief system, values, strengths, areas of development and your process of conducting business. You’re more than capable of reaching your maximum potential, but that’s only when you put in the desired effort.\n\n\nConvert your weaknesses into strengths\n\n\nSometimes we're so busy focusing on our strengths, we forget to acknowledge and concentrate on our weaknesses. It’s very important to own your weaknesses in order to ensure they don’t own you.\n\n\nAdjust your viewpoint\n\n\nStop judging yourself by your past successes or failures. Hold yourself accountable for your present and see the bigger picture. Analyze how useful your present leadership style is in the longer run. One smart way to accurately change the lens through which you're viewing yourself is via taking into account the feedback you receive.\n\n\nRemove all the existing obstacles\n\n\nKnowingly or unknowingly, we are all our worst enemies at times and put obstacles in our own paths. What’s important is you figuring out the obstacles and then rooting them out successfully.\n\n\nAlways think of yourself as a work in progress and constantly keep evolving according to the need of the hour. Leadership is not a constant but an ever-evolving way of being.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, through our professional search, we help you source leaders who have a proven track record of pushing past their limits and realize their true potential.

    "content": "How to Be A Proactive Business Leader\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nMark Firth\n/\nThursday, October 31, 2019\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a stark difference between the reactive and the proactive leader. More often than not reactive leaders are in a state of constant activity striving to achieve business goals to the best of their abilities. On the other hand, proactive leaders lean more towards championing organizational missions and achieve goals with greater ease. While reactive leaders are known to deal with events as they come, proactive leaders anticipate events and plan accordingly. Being proactive not only simplifies leadership but also increases positive results and encourages a more harmonious workplace.\n\n\nThe business benefits of being proactive are undeniable. Here’s is how you can make ‘being proactive’ a part of your DNA:\n\n\n1. Slow down\n\n\nMost people are so driven towards short-term targets and successes that they fail to keep the bigger picture in mind while making bold decisions. As a leader, one needs to slow down and take a step back, access the long-term plan and then take necessary steps that will help you achieve that bigger picture. Sometimes one needs to stop doing and start thinking. Even if the situation requires you to speed up, take a minute to study the pros and cons and prepare for the worst-case scenario to avoid being blindsided in the longer run. Slowing down gives you mind space, an overview of the situation at hand and time to cultivate a plan of action with proper responsibilities, accurate yet achievable timelines and unique ways of communication.\n\n\n2. Plan ahead\n\n\nAccording to a famous Chinese saying, your plans might fail, but planning ahead never does. You can only control how you react to a situation, not the situation itself. This is where planning in advance comes to use. Taking a proactive stance helps you face reality and mentally prepares you for the worst-case scenario. Carefully study all possibilities along with their pros and cons. One should analyze the situation in advance, calculate the risk and make a foolproof salvation plan.\n\n\n3. Keep everyone in the loop\n\n\nManage your team well, keep them informed and share all your predictions with your employees so as to mentally prepare them and help them brace for impact.\n\n\n4. Exude confidence in hard times\n\n\nA smart leader always gets excited during changes rather than being terrified of them. They plan ahead and are always ready to pounce on whatever situation that might come their way. Keep a calm and confident approach during the difficult times when your competitors might be crumbling under the stress of survival. Exuding confidence makes everyone from your employees to investors believe that you have what it takes to survive and assures them that their future and money is safe.\n\n\nBeing proactive is a critical skill when it comes to the success of a business. Therefore, leaders who wish to make a lasting impact on their organization should strive for proactive, rather than reactive leadership.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, through our professional Executive Search Process, we help you source leaders who have a proven track record of proactively leading businesses towards excellence.\n\n\nTo know more about our services like leadership consulting, professional executive search, management consulting, visit \nwww.TaplowGroup.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (6436)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "3 Reasons To Use An Executive Search Firm For Your Hiring Needs\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nMark Firth\n/\nWednesday, October 9, 2019\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 3.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you know that a bad hiring decision more often than not, can cause a negative ripple effect through the organization? This includes everything, right from factoring in salary and training time, along with loss of business opportunities or clients from the disruption, and reduction in team morale.\n\n\nSome of the very common mistakes that the hiring managers make are asking the wrong questions, not articulating the company culture or the job requirements, and not evaluating the candidate as per the role at hand or not knowing the job requirements completely.\n\n\nSo how does one avoid these pitfalls?\n\n\nOne of the best ways to ensure that you have the type of professionals you need is to engage an executive search firm. They will be able to provide you with top-notch talent by taking care of the hiring process end to end which will include gathering information on the candidates, shifting through them, selecting the best ones based on the job description provided, evaluating and assessing them, setting up interviews with the stakeholders, reference checks and finally onboarding.\n\n\nHere are 3 reasons why should you consider hiring an executive search firm for the hiring needs of your organization.\n\n\n1. It saves you both, time and money\n\n\nLooking through CVs can be a tedious task and requires an expert eye. It is easy to miss out on many important details. This can prove to be disastrous, especially when you are hiring for a leadership position.\n\n\n2. The role could be beyond the internal team’s expertise\n\n\nThis happens with most of the leadership and business critical roles. The internal teams are unable to conduct refine searches that are typically required to fulfill such roles. On the other hand, Executive Search Firms, have the knowledge and expertise that’s required to hire for a specific position. So, you know for sure that you will get the right person for the position.\n\n\n3. The position is new or needs to be rebuilt\n\n\nNew positions are particularly difficult to hire for because, first, there is no benchmark to serve as a point of reference to determine the skills and expertise needed and secondly, in most cases it could require hiring a candidate from a different field altogether. For example, if an automobile giant is looking for a Chief Digital Officer, it will have to look for someone from an IT/Tech sector.\n\n\nTypically, when the position falls outside the standard scope, Executive Search Firms are the safest bet for an organization to find the kind of talent they are looking to hire. At The Taplow Group, we help organizations meet their hiring needs with the best talent available in the market.

Every leader, irrespective of his or her position or successes, needs to persistently work on leadership development. After one has climbed his or her way to the top of the corporate ladder or reached a certain level in their career, it’s easy to sit back and put everything on autopilot. However, settling for the status quo and never taking risks or learning new skills can stall any career, no matter how glorious! To be an effective leader, one must remain committed to learning and adapting at all times.\n\n\nIn today’s competitive business world, leaders need to continually refine their leadership skills and adapt to the ever-changing dynamics of the workplace in order to remain viable. However, this in no way means just taking one leadership development class and then going back to the same old humdrum of corporate life. Leadership development is an ongoing process. It begins with learning new skills and gaining experience by applying those skills. As Albert Einstein once said, “I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.” Leaders must possess the ability to translate their knowledge into action and continue on this journey throughout their career and life.\n\n\nSo what is it that one needs to successfully develop oneself into a leader? As a leader one needs to be self aware because it won’t be possible to understand the needs and perspectives of your followers if you don't first understand yourself. This is the reason organizations invest in 360-feedback and executive coaching for their leadership development programs. These methods provide feedback about what one is doing and how it affects others.\n\n\nAlso, giving ‘knee-jerk’ reactions or using the same strategy in different circumstances can spell trouble for leaders in the long run. They need to control their impulses and learn how to analyze situations in order to think about the big picture and long-term results. Through self reflection the leaders can initiate the correct actions at the right time and in the right situations. As a leader you also need to develop a leadership identity that serves as a positive role model for your followers. The zeal to be that ideal leader motivates further development.\n\n\nHere are a few suggestions that you can use to amp up your leadership development journey.\n\n\nBooks - Just imagine a topic and there exists a book! Right from leading successful teams to managing workplace conflicts; books are an ideal way to hone your leadership skills at your own pace.\n\n\nProfessional Development Programs – Whether you are looking at up skilling your leadership skills or increasing business success and profitability, these programs go a long way to improve your efficiency as a leader.\n\n\nMentoring - Mentoring can be an extremely rewarding experience as it allows you not only to share your skills but also learn from the one you are mentoring.\n\n\nAll said and done, in order to remain effective as a leader one must remain committed to learning and adapting at all stages of their life and career. At our CEO Institute, we help you embark on ajourney that ensures that you master the skills you need to manage effective and productive teams.

    "content": "Maximizing Organizational Success Through Human Capital Management\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nMark Firth\n/\nThursday, September 19, 2019\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a strong link between Human Capital Management and Organizational Performance. Organizational effectiveness largely depends on having the right people in the right jobs at the right time to meet rapidly changing organizational requirements. Right people can be found by following best practices for human capital management.\n\n\nThe management of people within the organization has become increasingly important. Therefore, human resources function of an organization should not just handle recruitment, pay, and discharging, but also should maximize the use of an organization’s human capital in a more strategic manner. For example, they should become more employee-centric by focusing on enhancing employees’ engagement and organizational commitment.\n\n\nIn today’s competitive world, organizations strive to achieve high levels of competency and competitiveness. Human capital management practices are known to contribute effectively towards profitability, quality, and other goals in line with the mission and vision of an organization. However, in order to be effective, it requires the coordination of planning, implementation, and assessment across all departments of an organization.\n\n\nAs a good leader you can make all the difference in the way employees operate within your organization by utilizing the “human capital management” concept. In fact, Gallup estimates that leaders account for at least 70 percent of the variance in employee engagement scores across businesses.\n\n\nHere are a few tips that can help you improve the way you manage your people:\n\n\nKnow your employees by name and use them often - \n It is not uncommon for employees to feel unimportant or like one of many, especially in the vast ocean of employees in a large organization. Though you may not interact with all employees frequently, ensure you know who each employee in your organization is and what is it that they bring to the table. Maintaining employee profiles can help you keep track of important employee facts such as date of hire, roles, and background of skills.\n\n\nRecognize employee achievements - \n Another way to boost employee engagement is to celebrate employee milestones and other important events. Make an effort to keep track of these important events and keep team members in the loop to help you execute these celebrations.\n\n\nFast – track the approval process – If an employee has requested for a time off ,ensure that you respond quickly. This is for the sole reason that they should \n be able to plan their lives outside of work, and anything that makes that more difficult can make employees feel anxious or discouraged. \n This holds true for work related approvals as well because if you don’t provide feedback in time they may begin to overanalyze or doubt their ideas as they await feedback.\n\n\nFor an organization, its employees should hold incredible value as they are the ones who are both responsible and capable of doing great things. But in order for them to operate at peak performance, they need a good leader. At The Taplow Group, we help organizations source the talent they seek.

This is an extremely important function of human resources that involves attracting highly qualified, competent and dedicated work force to an organization. As the business attempts to achieve its objectives, it must ensure that it is able to maintain a robust and cohesive process for recruiting, managing, supporting and compensating the employees. Executive search firms play a significant role in ensuring that organizations hire the right people for existing and future job roles.\n\n\nWorkforce is the most important part of an organization. An organization is only as strong as its workforce. Therefore, organizations must recognize and build on superior talent focusingon their personal strengths and interests, thus ensuring that they fit into the long term business plan.\n\n\nIt’s not always about an organization’s aspirations but also an employee’s aspirations. When someone joins an organization, they know for sure that they have been selected for a position because they have the ability to succeed in that position. What they are more interested to know is that whether the organization is going to continue to develop them into becoming top performers and that’s exactly where talent management comes into play.\n\n\nToday’s workforce is looking for organizations with strong talent management systems that will recognize their individual efforts, reward their performance, and give them opportunities for growth and development in the future.\n\n\nIt is a huge responsibility to run a successful organization and if it is left to the greenhorns, the results can be catastrophic. This can have a huge negative impact on the entire organization.\n\n\nThe executive search firms play a pivotal role in ensuring that organizations hire the right people. Searching for the right resource can be very challenging, so it is always better to leave it to the experts. To bring someone on board who is not well qualified or well matched will prove to be a costly mistake for the organization in the long run.\n\n\nOne of the main things that the executive search firms excel in doing is to search for the right resources. They get the right people because they utilize their experience and have man power that’s trained and dedicated solely for this purpose. They ensure that they give their full attention to this effort so as to match their client’s needs and demands.\n\n\nJust to reiterate, talent management in any organization is a fairly complex process that should be handled very skilfully. As it involves hiring the best resources for the open positions available, engaging an expert to handle the entire executive search process is a sensible investment for any organization. Keep in mind that if the process is not done correctly, it could cost the organization a lot of time and money in the long run!\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, we leave no stone unturned in our quest to search the right talent for your organization.

A consistent and focused approach to managing intellectual capital within the organization has a positive impact on the business. Talent management plays an important role in the business strategy since it manages one of the important assets of the company—its people.\n\n\nWhy Do Organizations Need to Invest in Talent Management?\n\n\nAttract Top-Talent: It creates an employer brand that could attract potential talent.\n\n\nRetain Top Talent: Well-structured on-boarding practices create higher levels of retention.\n\n\nEmployee Motivation: Having a strategic talent management strategy helps organizations keep its employees motivated which, in turn, increases business performance.\n\n\nFilling Critical Roles: Effective talent management ensures that there will be a continuous flow of employees to fill critical roles.\n\n\nClient Satisfaction: Strategic and systematic planning means there is a consistent approach to management. When systems are more integrated, client satisfaction rates are usually higher.\n\n\nWhat is the Role of a Team Manager in Talent Management, and the Relevance of the same?\n\n\nThe major difference between the organizations that use Human Capital Management or Performance Management is their focus on the managers’ role. Practitioners of Talent Management give their managers a substantial role and responsibility in the entire recruitment process. These managers also have a significant role in the ongoing development and retention of leadership roles. Majority of the work systems are completely in the hands of the employee's manager.\n\n\nThis does not mean that the role of HR is eliminated. The main responsibility is of the HR team- to provide support, training, backup, and to also take the lead in the hire to exit process. HR is also deeply involved in the performance management system, career planning, and so forth. However, the team managers are the means to execute the above-mentioned activities.\n\n\nHow to Integrate Talent Management in Your Organization?\n\n\nAs an effective talent management strategy, a talented employee and his/her potential must be identified and shared across the organization. This creates awareness and it becomes easier to identify available talent whenever the opportunity arises. It ensures that the best talent is already trained and is ready to take charge of the higher position. Succession planning not only benefits the employees and it benefits the organization in the longer run.\n\n\nTalent management is a business strategy that should be fully integrated within the organization. Attracting and retaining talented employees is essential for organizations’ overall growth.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, we assist you in searching for exceptional talent, which is in tandem with your business need and culture. Our unique and powerful approach to finding the best talent has transformed and revitalized HR programs for many of our partner organizations. We focus on finding the best talent for your organization who can accelerate the growth and lead your organization for future success.

Based on their skills and management abilities, a leader can make or break the foundation of organizational culture. And, this is one of the main reasons that leadership development is a key activity for many organizations. Organizations also rely on leaders to bring about transformation and innovation, and hence they see leadership development as an activity that benefits business in the long run.\n\n\nHere are Top 4 Benefits of Leadership Development.\n\n\nLeadership development creates skilled and empowered leaders\n – By participating in a leadership development program one may learn important leadership skills and attributes that they need to be an effective leader, such as communication skills, motivation and inspiration, as well as better decision-making skills and accountability.\n\n\nLeadership development improves financial performance\n – Leadership development programs enable leaders to engages employees’ minds, stimulate their creativity, challenge them to learn, reward their growth and tap into their desire to improve. Thus, helping the organization achieve its strategic objectives through enterprise-wide alignment and cross-functional troubleshooting.\n\n\nLeadership development helps to attract and retain talent\n – Lack of opportunities for growth is one of the main reasons that employees start looking for openings elsewhere. When it comes to attracting, and then retaining talent, developing your people goes a long way. Helping them strengthen their knowledge and \nleadership skill\n set goes a long way in boosting productivity, collaboration and overall satisfaction from the job.\n\n\nLeadership development increases agility\n - There is an old saying that change is the only constant and change is integral to improvement, and improvement must be an ongoing process. In order to sustain and improve in the volatile business environment, it becomes imperative that leaders are agile and can respond and adapt to change with minimal disruption. \nLeadership development\n programs enable leaders to evaluate how their teams and technology can work together to add value and achieve greater business outcomes.\n\n\nFocused on the day-to-day business needs, it’s not always viable to think about taking out time for leadership development.

To stay competitive, organizations are embracing change at a rapid pace. This fast paced change necessitates increased focus on developing and establishing the traits of flexibility and adaptability amongst leadership.\n\n\nIn the literal sense, flexibility means being open to new ideas and concepts, ability to work on an independent basis or with a team as the situation demands, and managing multiple projects without getting stumped when situations change at a moment’s notice. The ability or degree of readiness to which one adapts in such situations essentially determines one’s level of flexibility.\n\n\nFlexibility is also an important trait when it comes to putting people at ease. It is often believed that the best leaders can connect with anyone, by being flexible in their own style to make the other person comfortable and able to contribute their best to the conversation or interaction. When challenging situations arise, flexibility as a leadership trait brings camaraderie and collaboration in the team.\n\n\nIn spite of the demands and constraints of a position, here’s how leaders can become more flexible and adaptive.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a well-known Chinese proverb that says that the wise adapt themselves to circumstances, as water molds itself to the pitcher. By being flexible to new ideas and open-minded enough to consider them, as a leader you increase the likelihood of finding the best possible solution to a given challenge.\n\n\nMove out of your comfort zone. If a situation is uncomfortable, that probably means you have a chance to learn something new. This coming out of the comfort zone will enable you to look at the manner in which you engage with people, approach situations, make decisions, and evaluate opportunities.\n\n\nLeadership is not just about building and shaping an organizational vision but also recognizing when it is time to listen to some good ideas from other team members. Flexibility is all about building a vision through collaboration. As the African proverb says, “If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.”\n\n\n\n\nTo become an effective, flexible leader takes both, time and patience. Embrace the experiences, and seek the learning opportunities in each one. As you move towards being a flexible leader, you will be surprised to discover that your professional effectiveness has also increased. At The Taplow Group, we are adept at sourcing leaders for your organization who are able to \"think on their feet\" and can develop an organizational culture that values and encourages flexibility.

Companies usually opt for it to make their business more profitable, organized and integrated. However, sometimes it is also seen as a sign of instability and that the company is struggling to stay afloat. This might leave the investors worrisome and unsure.\n\n\nRestructuring is a very common procedure during mergers. It is also undertaken to boost profits by increasing efficiency. Organizational restructuring is also a byproduct of change in overall goals, motto or nature of business. It helps implement new methods of work culture to meet new requirements. In this era of ever changing technology, it is also carried out to deal with newer innovations.\n\n\nDuring an organizational restructuring exercise, one needs to prioritize quality over quantity. When it comes to employees, those, who are truly benefitting and adding value to the business, should be prioritized. While there is no particular manual for rightful restructuring, one should opt for strategies that suit their organization the most. However, thinking out of the box and being bold enough to pull all the stops is a mandate, especially to ensure that you don't have to redo this for a while, and it provides the required long-term results.\n\n\nOrganizational restructuring, leads to decrease in operational costs. Some other key benefits of restructuring are improved communication, quicker decision making due to lesser layers between simplified senior management and employees and increased operational efficiency leading to more control. One other key advantage of conducting an organizational restructuring exercise is added focus on teams over individual success.\n\n\nOrganizational restructuring and its consequences completely depend on your reason behind doing it, strategy and implementation. If any of the steps involved are not conducted properly, it can go south real soon. Hence, it can be a boon or a bane, depending on how you conduct it.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, we help organizations to navigate their way to a successful organization design that helps them to get on the right to path to achieve their business goals.

Leaders are a company’s backbone, hence for a company to evolve and prosper, it is of utmost importance that leaders constantly evolve and learn on the go. A leader needs to keep up to remain relevant and grow the business.\n\n\nHere’s our list of some of the top leadership skills for 2020:\n\n\n\n\nBreakthrough Thinking\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most highly sought after leadership skills is 360 degree thinking. It is imperative for someone who aspires to be a phenomenal leader to have thorough knowledge of their industry and the upcoming trends that can help drive the business further.\n\n\n\n\nHaving a versatile intellect\n\n\n\n\nIt’s not just vital having a vast knowledge of your field; it’s also essential to be able to implement it correctly at the right moment. A step in the right direction during a crisis is what makes all the difference. It’s not necessary or healthy to be so engrossed in your work that you completely lose touch of the outer world. One needs to devote time to their hobbies and interests, and they often fuel inspiration. They also play a key role in rejuvenation of the mind and help you stay resilient during the kind of days that are capable of taking a toll on you.\n\n\n\n\nBe approachable and professionally humble\n\n\n\n\nA leader needs to repeatedly use the company’s policy and ideologies in day to day conversations. This helps the employees get a better sense of what’s expected of them and the company’s values get ingrained in their minds.\n\n\n\n\nUnwavering Commitment to what’s right\n\n\n\n\nAs a leader, one needs to commit to making the right decision while keeping the company’s values and their personal values aligned. Harmony between the company’s beliefs and your own beliefs results in the best results and helps you make the most appropriate choices. It is also important to keep the employees in the loop so that they comprehend the reasons behind difficult actions, and support them.\n\n\n\n\nEmbrace feedback with open arms\n\n\n\n\nOnce in a while, take a minute from your long hours at work, and reflect on your actions and ability to take feedback with a smile. If a leader takes criticism positively and isn’t rigid, it helps promote change-friendly culture in the organization. Introspection is key for improvement.\n\n\n\n\nInspire people into following you\n\n\n\n\nA leader should be extremely open with the employees and should explain company’s challenges and the opportunities that they’re seeking or going after. This motivates people to work collectively towards the end goal. Make people believe that you’re working in the company’s best interest, so that even if you make a decision that doesn’t benefit a set of employees personally, there still won’t be bad beef. Inspire passion towards the organization for the best results.\n\n\n\n\nEncourage collaboration\n\n\n\n\nA good leader needs to understand the importance of working as a team. “Team work makes the dream work” should be your motto. One has to motivate and encourage everyone to have a voice and create a barrier-free environment where they can freely express their opinion.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, we are adept at sourcing leaders who are perfectly aligned with your organizational vision.

Therefore, it’s imperative that the CIO reports to the individual whose major focus is the organization’s overall strategic performance i.e., the CEO.\n\n\nIn today’s competitive world a CIO is expected to have so much more than just technical competence. They should display leadership qualities, and possess considerable business acumen when it comes to strategy, growth and relationships\n\n\nAccording to a recent study by Deloitte, a growing number of global CIOs are reporting to CEOs. This is more likely to happen in cases where CIO is at helm of digital transformation. A direct reporting line to the CEO facilitates increased visibility, stronger sponsorship of efforts and a better overall collaborative environment. Most CIOs prefer reporting to the CEO over the CFO for IT budgeting and strategy as well.\n\n\nOn the other hand, CFOs tend to get surrounded by numbers, such as ROI, cost benefit analysis and payback periods—all of which are important in building the business case—but numbers have a tendency to slow down the decision-making in the long run. CFOs are often not open to taking risks. They are of the opinion that their main priority is securing the organization’s finances, so they need to be cautious, control expenditure and implement stringent processes.\n\n\nWhen reporting to the CFO, the CIO may feel the pressure to operate conservatively and therefore run the risk of missing opportunities to gain competitive advantage, especially in the long-run. CIOs should be able to offer their expertise when it comes to decision making about the future direction of their organizations and that can happen only when they get more visibility for IT and attention to key decisions about its utilisation. \n\n\n“The quickening pace of digitalization and technological innovation are changing the CIO role from delivery executive to business executive,” Gartner says. \n\n\nThe most recent Harvey Nash/KPMG CIO Survey (released a year ago) shows 62 percent of CIOs as members of their organization’s executive committee compared to 38 percent in 2005. The likelihood that CIOs are reporting to the CEO rather than the CFO or someone else is rising by about 10 percent a year.\n\n\nAs organizations turn their attention to digital innovation as a top priority, they are counting on CIOs to drive it. CEOs no longer see IT as a cost center but as a differentiator, a center of innovation, and an enabler of revenue growth and market differentiation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (7516)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "IT’s Game of Thrones – The CIO vs. CDO War\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nMark Firth\n/\nMonday, May 20, 2019\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs organizations look to strengthen their digital transformation initiatives one question that crosses everyone’s mind is that can CIOs act as the CDOs for organizations today? Or there exists a need a separate CDO who can partner with the business and IT to drive digital transformation?\n\n\nTo seek an answer to this question, one must take a deep dive into how innovation takes place in organizational settings. IT has always been at the forefront when it comes to strategic deployment of new technologies for business transformation. But the role of technology has reached far beyond just supporting business operations. Today, technology is enabling data management, reporting, and analytics, which help to deliver improved customer experiences and create innovative business models. This has opened up new revenue streams through digitally enhanced, data-driven products, services, and experiences.\n\n\nGartner refers to bimodal innovation which has 2 modes. Innovation in mode 1 is focused on IT infrastructure efficiency and reliability where as in Mode 2 innovation is focused on increasing business agility, transforming customer-facing processes and customer experiences, and developing new business models.In mode 1, the CIO runs the IT organization wherein he/she commands what can be done and what can’t be done on the IT systems, what can be accessed and what can’t be. The CIO is in charge and in control. In mode 2, as one moves to the world of digital, it is the customer who is in control and demands what he/she wants.\n\n\nThe answer to the question lies in understanding the difference between data and information and how these are respectively managed in order to achieve improved intelligence and insights for an organization. For example, investing in new digital platforms is critical to enabling digital transformation initiatives. But sometimes digital transformation can’t be scaled to the organization as a whole because of incompatibilities with core systems, lack of security, or compliance issues etc. The person in charge ( most likely a CIO) struggles to manage both, the transactional IT stack and the digital stack. There’s a need for a better operating model between the two and how they will work together.\n\n\nAccording to The SAP Digital Transformation Executive Study, in order to be successful organizations must combine the best of these modes to follow what is typically known as a bimodal approach to innovation. However, the traditional CIO role largely encompasses keeping the company running efficiently and effectively, at the lowest cost and least disruption. In comparison, CDOs are more about disruption and digital transformation. In some organizations, the CIO and a CDO are clearly defined. For example, the CIO influences digital decisions while also overseeing the IT operation across the workforce where as a CDO can be seen as a supporting role to the CIO in developing digital initiatives to help the organisation.\n\n\nThe traditional CIO can be interpreted as a manager of continuity while the CDO is a manager of change. Organizations very well understand the fact that they need to balance continuity of the current business on the one hand with rapid technological change and deep strategic transformations on the other, which is why the two separate leadership roles exist. But then again, a large number of CIOs are looking at bridging the gap between the two, blurring both roles and making the position of CDO redundant!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (9357)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

It highlights the need to build diverse teams which can work cohesively to earn revenue and growth. A CIO is no longer just the  technical liaison for the rest of the C-suite, he is the technical leader of the entire organization. He has the capability to offer technical guidance in major decisions that affect the company as a whole. For example, he can look at the data and tell you why the supply chain is going down or what’s the best plan to adopt new methodologies across organization to achieve rapid growth.\n\n\nWhether it is about installing enterprise resource planning systems or working with the business to imagine the customer’s journey, the CIOs have always been firm believers of the fact that smart processes always win. They always think of holistic ways for departmental, functional, and operational growth. This couldn’t be more true than in today’s digital world where everything is part of a larger system. Having spent a major part of their careers looking across systems and analyzing different trends, the CIO is the perfect person to look at big data and help organizations drive business growth and maintain a competitive edge.\n\n\nTechnology is the driver of new and more effective ways of doing business. It enables an organization to use data, software, devices, and new platforms/channels that can help to bring the organization into a new league of business operations and opportunities. CIOs of today are equally involved in both, business and technology to ensure that the organization is set on the right technology and systems foundation to achieve growth. While IT is still performing its traditional role of managing day-to-day operations, the CIO is increasing being looked upon as someone who must chart a digital strategy for the organization to reach and engage with its customers.\n\n\nCIOs must consider certain things as key priorities as they navigate their role from just being responsible for internal operations to leading strategic business objectives. For example, CIOs must champion disruption, not just for shaking things up but also for defining a better course of action to achieve accelerated growth. With big data, the CIOs have the perfect opportunity to understand the business with a much greater accuracy and context. For example, business intelligence generated by applications about behaviour, user engagement of a product can be turned into a meaningful insight by the CIO which can be used to make better business decisions about product development, marketing, and sales. The rise of analytics capabilities presents an excellent opportunity for CIOs to classify and sort the information to make it available for analysis.\n\n\nGone are the days when IT used to hold back all the data. Now is the time to distribute it to business users to drive decisions. CIO is the new growth hacker for an organization as he has the perfect opportunity to combine his technology experience with business knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (19136)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

While the earlier role of CIOs was limited to just build and operate cost-effective IT infrastructure along with automation of business processes, now they are expected to increase their focus on revenue growth, customer experience, along with data-based insight. Digital disruption caused by increased spends on cloud, e-commerce, mobile, analytics, and social has enabled CIOs to help drive strategy, innovation, and revenue growth. As the role of digital technologies in the business continues to rise, they are expected to deliver more value than ever before. \n\n\nSo, what exactly does it take to be a successful CIO amidst such change and transformation?\n\n\nThe CIO role has become more strategic and knowledgeable in relation to improving customer journey, experiences and services. For example, organizations that spends millions of dollars on digital marketing (which is primarily an IT function) often report to a CMO. They can always turn to their CIO to look for a better technology experience for their end users. Also, the businesses now have access to more data than ever before. A CIO can help transform that data into meaningful insight and help eliminate problem areas, speed up production and get more products to market in a shorter time span. The result is an increase in productivity and overall efficiency, leading to an increase in profitability.\n\n\nCIOs are fast becoming central to business decisions, bringing in greater efficiencies and consistent innovation. They are being sought after to maximise productivity and promote the benefits of technology. For example, they can help to use disruptive technologies that can yield major financial benefits while continuing to improve internal processes and finding cost efficiencies.\n\n\nThe need for scalability, high performance, and flexibility has blurred the line between business and IT. The future role of a CIO would also be to understand how every department would be using technology tools and ensure a return on investment is achieved. Thus, driving the future success of the business.\n\n\nAccording to a recent survey by Gartner at least 84% of top CIOs surveyed have responsibility for areas of the business outside traditional IT. Agile IT is the highway of the future. As more and more organizations recognize the strategic value that technology plays, the CIO role shifts from traditional to transformational.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (6309)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

In order to be highly productive, it has become important to take insights and inputs from various fields that help achieve a singular goal. \n\n\nChange can be a motivational factor for Job Seekers. Change is an opportunity to explore something new or add to your skill-set and job seekers imply the same when they are looking for a job change. There are three primary factors that motivate job seekers to look into opportunities in a new industry:\n\n\n1. Exposure and addition to skill set.\n\n\n2. Limited opportunities or extensive challenges. \n\n\n3. Better career progression in other industries. \n\n\nThese are driven individuals and the best bunch can prove to be vital determinants for the growth of the organisation. \n\n\nHow Hiring from other industries can benefit your organisation? \n\n\nAre internal recruitment/talent teams involved? (If not, is this an opportunity?)\n\n\nA lot of questions arise when hiring from another industry comes into the picture and they are true to their fact. But there comes a point when organisations do experience a burning out point. In this situation, the injection of fresh ideas and motivated talent can prove to be highly beneficial for organisations. There are two strategic directions which essentially encourages organisations to experiment with talents from different industries: \n\n\n1. Injection of “Fresh Blood”: There are times when employees are completely burnt out and the introduction of new talents can help re-stimulating these employees with fresh ideas and new objectives. \n\n\n2. Addition of a whole new skill set: Organisations looking to expand their services need to bring in professionals from the industry they want to expand into to help them successfully establish and transition. For example, promoting e-books will need talent from the digital industry to procreate your material in a manner that sells in the digital world. \n\n\nAgain these candidates can prove to be strong catalysts for growth as they help find another approach towards achieving a goal or help in upgrading your offerings, both ways become a win-win situation for organisations. \n\n\nIt may be risky, but it does not have to be…\n\n\nHiring from other industries can be risky but if done in the right way, it can be very productive for the organization. Few qualities like open-minded, adaptable, good communication skills and cultural sensitivity are some important factors to consider when hiring talents from different industries. However, the more important factors lie in their skill-sets, motivation level and how driven they are to quickly adapt and be productive for the organisation. \n\n\nAt The Taplow Group S.A, our team spreads over several countries and moreover promotes the hiring of diverse talents.

Organisations are heavily investing in methods towards employee re-engagement and are looking for innovative methods to keep the curve of productivity continuously progressing.\n\n\nTo this, there are several key points that can be inculcated towards increasing employee engagement and productivity:\n\n\n1. Don’t be Afraid to Delegate:\n\n\nOne of the toughest jobs to do but can provide highly beneficial results. One of the major hindrances towards this is a personal feeling that delegation might lead to a work that is not up to the mark but on the hindsight, it provides you more opportunities to think and evaluate your work and also increases ownership amongst your team.\n\n\n2. Match Tasks to Skills:\n\n\nKnowing your employees’ skills and behavioural styles is essential for maximizing efficiency. Assign tasks according to the skill sets and your team will enjoy working as they can experience progress which works as an incentive for motivation and thus increases the feeling of accomplishment when the goals are delivered, thus adding to higher productivity.\n\n\n3. Communicate Effectively:\n\n\nEvery manager knows that communication is the key to a productive workforce. With the introduction of several technological advancements, communication has been hindered. Even though it may reach out faster to a larger audience, if not communicated clearly, it can have detrimental effects. On the other hand, communicating personally, or actually following up removes any doubts if occurred and also facilitates interpersonal relationships.\n\n\n4. Incentivize Employees:\n\n\nOne of the best ways to encourage employees to be more efficient is to actually give them a reason to do so. Recognizing your workers for a job well done will make them feel appreciated and encourage them to continue increasing their productivity.\n\n\n5. Celebrate with your team:\n\n\nAfter every accomplishment, get together and celebrate the efforts together. This eliminates the factor of hierarchy and instils the values of togetherness and team-effort. This also means that the efforts are recognised and rewarded well after the accomplishment of the tasks. This keeps the motivation level at its peak throughout.\n\n\nCommunication has been the way forward for time immemorial now and presently many of us lack effective communicative skills. Using the above-mentioned tips, communicate effectively with your team and reap higher productivity from them.\n\n\nAt the Taplow Group S.A, we are focused on identifying such leaders who can prove to be highly productive for our clients.

Here is why!\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nMark Firth\n/\nMonday, April 1, 2019\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the increased rate of competition and opportunities, ensuring the same progress with productivity has been one of the major tasks for managers. It is quite evident that even a motivated workforce shows signs of burning out over a period of time. Keeping this issue in the mind, it has become imperative for organisations and managers to enact employee engagement programs in order to keep the morale high and also ensuring a constant motivation towards success.\n\n\nFocused, driven and meaningful conversations can act as catalysts towards improving employee engagement but in hindsight, if the leader or manager fails to communicate effectively, it can prove detrimental for the organisation.\n\n\nIn order to communicate effectively, leaders can follow certain practices that essentially formulate engaging and clear communication strategies:\n\n\n1. If every individual is different, your communication cannot be generic.\n\n\nIndividuals become a team, and we manage the individuals within the team, hence the communication should focus on each individual and their attributes. Here are certain tips and tricks you can employ in order to manage and communicate effectively with the individuals:\n\n\n\n\nOrganised and streamlined communication helps and improves disorganised employees.\n\n\nAllowing a certain amount of autonomy to top performers.\n\n\nIncentives for people who are performing. Public recognition can be very motivating for Individuals.\n\n\nRecognise the modest employees with subtle praises.\n\n\n\n\nEveryone absorbs information in different ways. Identifying these parameters will essentially help you communicate with them better and also they will assimilate what you have to say.\n\n\n2. Consistency is the key to continuous communication.\n\n\nThe lack of definite deliverables and job responsibilities can also hinder employee engagement within the organisation. These can also be the root causes of employee underperformance. To keep this in check, it is important to first communicate the deliverables and responsibilities clearly, have a continuous follow-up to understand the employees' progress, grievances and difficulties if any. This helps in establishing a comfortable and engaging relationship between the manager and the employee.\n\n\n3. Be Objective, not Reflexive with your emotions.\n\n\nHaving control over your emotions and they not influencing your interactions with your fellow employees is a vital part of effective communication. Temper is not good for communication but we are all humans and as a general trait, we do tend to get angry but the important measure would be to assess these kinds of situations and proactively act towards it. Understanding how your employees perceive you when you yell and how accommodating they are to the same is a vital metric that needs to be observed along with how such heated conversations are affecting your working environment, either positively or negatively.\n\n\n4. Praise More, Criticize Less\n\n\nEveryone likes appreciation and recognition for the effort they put in. The best managers identify these efforts and praise them in a continuous manner to ensure the continuity of productivity. Moreover, the best managers create an environment in which their employees wants to excel. Mutual respect is best fostered through praise, support and steady encouragement. Creating a positive work environment naturally leads to the creation of a more engaged workforce. By recognising the efforts of the employees, they feel empowered, supported, and are motivated to push themselves to the edge of their abilities to do the best job possible.\n\n\nAt the Taplow Group S.A, We are a team that focuses on identifying and delivering the best talents as required by our clients.

Consider these 3 key points.\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nMark Firth\n/\nThursday, March 7, 2019\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \nNo rating\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPushing an organization forward involves accounting several factors. Dynamic changes are undergone within the organization and certain strategies are needed to be developed in order to sustain a positive growth forward. Herein, developing organizations emphasize on the development of a leadership strategy which entails and pushes forward any organizations core values and offerings. A vision forward is the most vital value for any organization that is looking to develop and expand its services. The major screening factor remains to view this from an organizational context. By laying down a blue print of where the organization is headed and thus analyzing the same to define achievable goals is a quality today’s leaders need to possess to succeed in such a dynamic and competitive environment.\n\n\nAccording to recent studies conducted in the APAC region, the major findings of the study determined a sizeable disconnect among the leaders and their values in comparison to the organizations’ values they work for. Moreover marginally over half the organizations had clearly articulated a need for leadership strategy. Even those organizations, who have identified the required strategy and development programs to build leadership capabilities, often miss key details that impact the ultimate success of those programs.\n\n\nIn order to formulate the greatest impact from your leadership development programs, three key components can form the backbone of a strong leadership strategy. They can be identified as:\n\n\nExplain what leadership means to you and exemplify achievable goals.\n\n\nHaving a well-defined capability framework as the cornerstone of your leadership strategy will ensure your hires, promotions and development programs are all geared towards gaining the specific set of capabilities your organization needs most.\n\n\nBuild a team by identifying the required skills and values to grow. \n\n\nHiring practices come into focus here. When you hire someone, along with their capabilities, you’re also hiring their values and ideals and consider them to be additions to your team and organization. In order for fruitful growth, it is important to identify and eradicate possible negative elements that can hamper this growth process.\n\n\nDeveloping methodologies to continuously evaluate such development areas helps you build a heat map around your employees and thus develop developmental strategies based on these insights. This will also be helpful in creating a checklist of values and traits you would want to include in your organizations, thus making the hiring processes even more streamlined with the companies’ values.\n\n\nMake the right investment on your leaders. \n\n\nThe leaders you choose to lead are the major stakeholders of your organization. It is their skill-set that needs to be continuously evaluated and nurtured in order to create a sustainable pipeline of competent leaders. If the leaders fail to account for the dynamic changes, it might hamper the organization and in turn portray them as wasted resources and failed investments.\n\n\nAs an end goal, your leadership strategies should reflect the key responsibilities of your leaders and what they are expected to achieve. When leaders demonstrate the capabilities the organization needs most, and are backed with support to experiment and grow, it has a flow-on effect through the entire workplace, thus promoting a continuous and aligned leadership framework.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group S.A, we are continuously focused on identifying the right talent and potential leaders based on the values and skill-sets required by our clients.\n\n\nTo know more about how we can partner, reach out on \nwww.taplowgroup.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (7362)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

During the recent past, the hiring process has become a two-way street, where both the employer and candidate are in a position to accept or reject. This has swelled the importance of candidate experience. And when you are on the lookout for a C-level executive, the significance grows even higher. Today, talented candidates find themselves with a plethora of options, which subsequently has resulted in candidates being picky about their opportunities and started considering things other than the payroll while deciding which offer to accept.\n\n\nIt is evident that companies today pay good care and attention to proving a good candidate experience. However, the question remains, what further innovative measures can be employed to improve the hiring process along with identifying and hiring the best talent in the market.\n\r\nBelow outlined are four must-do practices:\n\n\nRestructure your job description to make it crisp and appropriate\n\n\nThe first step of a recruitment process is putting out the job description, and it is also the starting point to the candidate’s experience.  Many candidates complain that the job descriptions provided by the companies were either too vague (not giving much information) or too lengthy, both of which are equally frustrating. Therefore, focus on putting crisp and appropriate information in the job description, which might include the job profile, core responsibilities, location and little about the company and its values.\n\n\nStreamline your application process\n\n\nYour application process must be clear and non-fussy. Get rid of everything that even remotely makes the process lengthy and frustrating. For instance, the long forms asking the details that are already mentioned in the resumes is a common thing that not only makes the application process wearisome but also exudes a negative candidate experience.\n\n\nCommunicate with the applicants\n\n\nFrequent and quick communication with applicants immensely helps in establishing positive candidate experience. With the presently available tools and technology, it has become easier to keep the communication going. The hiring managers must set an automated email for people applying or sending cover letters while the prospects above that stage must be sent direct mails without delays. \n\n\nBreaking the Ice is very important!\n\n\nThe hiring process for everyone, even the candidates for the C-suite, can prove to be a very anxious period for the candidate. Therefore, employers must employ practices that can provide a comfortable environment for the candidates. This may include ice-breaking activities like a tour of the office or an introduction to the team members. Such activities not just make the candidates feel comfortable but are also an excellent opportunity for exhibiting the company’s work culture.\n\n\nToday’s hiring landscape does not allow you to bargain with candidate experience; it is something that you must actively work on to get the best talent on board. Streamline your hiring processes with the above mentioned parameters and facilitate competent hiring practices for your organization. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (6946)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "Diversity among your workforce: A practice for higher productivity\n\n\n“Possibilities are endless where unity in diversity exists.”\n\n\nAuthor: \nMark Firth\n/\nThursday, February 28, 2019\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \nNo rating\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent times, emphasis on creating a work environment and a value chain that aims at higher productivity has become the focal point of organisations. Focus towards incorporating innovative techniques is increasing and measures to map competent talent is being extensively researched. Furthermore, factors like increased competition and increased demand have resulted in companies extensively investing in and redefining their hiring practices, thus making human potential management the major influencer of any organisations growth. \n\r\nIntroduction of candidates from diverse backgrounds has been one successful practice that has resulted in a culturally accepted and productive environment. Considering the global market, the inclusion of people from different ethnicities has enabled organisations to gain insights globally and to also break barriers between nationalities and races, thus resulting in higher productivity. The major reason for this? Organisations are looking at becoming global players, and this includes it has become important for them to include hiring candidates that can be productive in their various geographical areas. But the inclusion of diversity among your workforce does not merely mean that you hire candidates from different nationalities but rather keep the biases aside and look the values you want to add to the organisation through these candidates. \n\r\nStated below are a few key parameters to keep in mind while altering your hiring practices to increase diversity within your organisation: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablish diversity to be of critical value to the organisation: Once such a structure is set, avoid looking for people “who are like you” and rather focus on identifying candidates that share the same ideas and practices, but contribute to the expansion of insights and productivity. Focusing on the candidate’s skill-sets rather than backgrounds is the right measure to increase secularity within the organisation. Consider this and diversity will be germane to your organisation’s future success.\n\n\nBuild an organisation with values, not positions! : Skill-set is important but cannot be considered as a sole measure while hiring. Filling positions can be taxing tasks as several credentials need to be considered and in the same way, it should not be rushed. Often talent acquisition professionals are under the pressure of filling up positions but that should not be the case. We need to keep the future of the organisation in mind rather than the immediate need and should address candidates based on the overall diversity of approaches and experiences that will help guide the team through growth and challenges.\n\n\nRemove subconscious biases from the hiring process: The usage of words in the job description plays an important role here. Certain words of praise or characteristic sometimes address a specific gender and should therefore be avoided. This can create a sense of unconscious bias among the talent acquisition professionals. Thus usage of words like creative, passionate and analytical promotes a general sentiment and should be encouraged.\n\n\nEmploy a diverse set of interviewers: Your interview panel can make a difference! A gender mix in your interview panel showcases homogeneity within your organisation thus promoting the candidate to share the ideals and virtues. In fact, experts say, one of the biggest deciding factors on whether or not a female candidate accepts a job is if there was a woman on the interview panel. Thus having interviewers belonging to different genders and races establishes that biases are not encouraged and only competency is gauged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (7546)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Either it's important to the organization or discretion is required in the process.\n\n\nTalent Acquisition is a science of its own – it is not just LinkedIn research or asking friends or people met in the same lift or bus, although sometimes you get lucky by doing just that. In real life, Executive Search requires a rare set of people skills and business expertise. This might be why being among the best in the world is considered an innovative and effective way of building a business.\n\n\n10 reasons to source\n top Leaders using an Executive Search Firm:\n\n\n1) Good vs Best: Do you plan to hire good or the best?\n\n\n2) Make-or-break factor: Executives within the C-suite often make or break a company.\n\n\n3) You are seeking a profile with a rare mix of skills combined with personality/behavior\n\n\n4) New executive position: Where to find someone to benchmark and share the best practices with?\n\n\n5) You have to replace an executive while he is still in the role. Sometimes companies need to take talent acquisition professionals into a higher level of confidentiality with a quiet phase.\n\n\n6) Confidentiality: Target profiles are in a target company that your company has a good relationship with. The confidentiality that search firms offer helps to keep the relationship with the business in the future.\n\n\n7) Your senior leadership team lacks diversity.\n\n\n8) You have few successors in your senior executive’s team and/or you just want to warrant proper corporate governance, and selecting an external party will keep the internal game fair and secure.\n\n\n9) You do not have the time or the resources to take on an executive search. It is not the skill or capability issue that lacks in your organization. It is about securing your own organization’s resource to create the most value.\n\n\n10) You have gone through potential shortcuts in your own network.\n\n\n\n\nTimo Jantti\n\n\nPartner, The Taplow Group - Finland\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (6059)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Harry S. Truman said, “Not all readers are leaders, but all leaders are readers.” Reading is a habit successful leaders must consider critical to their success.With the increased responsibilities and deliverables, it is imperative to continue to acquire knowledge in order to remain productive and at par with the market demands. Read on to know how this habit is both, enjoyable and plays a critical role in helping one become a better leader.\n\n\nReading makes you more adept and helps you articulate your ideas thoroughly, thus making you a good communicator\n\n\nThe most effective leaders are also the most effective communicators. Reading, is one of the quickest ways to acquire and assimilate new information. Reading increases verbal intelligence, making a leader more adept and an articulate communicator. All the historical and popular leaders are known to be inquisitive and avid readers. Words are powerful tools and reading helps you master them by helping you understand which words to use when. Whether you want to persuade or motivate, if you know how to convey the message correctly, you can definitely get things done your way.\n\n\nRead more, Think better.\n\n\nAs a leader, you’ll need a lot of general information to maintain perspective and seize opportunities. Reading helps you develop analytical skills, improves your judgement and problem-solving skills. Correctly sizing up a situation, and responding appropriately, is critical for being an effective leader.\n\n\nReading challenges you and gives you opportunities to interact with others\n\n\nReading a book that challenges your opinions can offer you newer perspectives and can have a big impact on your ability to think, both creatively and logically. The great thing about readers is that they love to share books or articles they think are worth reading and might benefit you. It is also a very important method for networking. Sharing perspectives, opinions and research material encourages dialogues and debates furthermore adding to your knowledge pool.\n\n\nIt has become imperative for today’s leaders to continuously gain knowledge and insights about the market they are performing in.\n\n\nAnother major point which reading and gathering knowledge leads to, is innovation.

    "content": "Benefits of Effective Communication in the Workplace\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nSuperUser Account\n/\nWednesday, January 2, 2019\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective communication is integral for the development of an organization. It is something that helps leaders perform on their basic functions of management- Planning, Organizing, Motivating and Controlling. Communication skills whether written or oral form the basis of any business activity whether product development, customer relations or employee engagement and retention.\n\n\nAccording to research, an improved communication strategy can immensely improve employee engagement. An engaged workforce propels an organization towards success. Focused, driven and meaningful conversation can act as a catalyst for improving employee engagement. However, if the leader or manager fails to communicate effectively, it can prove detrimental for the organisation.\n\n\nIn order to communicate effectively, leaders can follow certain practices that essentially formulate engaging and clear communication strategies:\n\n\n\n\n1.If every individual is different, your communication cannot be generic\n\n\nIndividuals form a team, and we manage the individuals within the team. Hence, the communication also needs to cater to and focus on each individual and their respective attributes. Everyone absorbs information in a different way. Identifying these ways will essentially help you communicate with them better and help them understand you, and what you have to say, better.\n\n\n2. Consistent communication is continuous communication\n\n\nThe lack of definite deliverables and job responsibilities can hinder employee engagement within the organisation. These can also be the root causes of employee underperformance. To keep this in check, it is important to first communicate the deliverables and responsibilities clearly and also have continuous follow ups to understand the progress of the team along with their grievances. if any. This in turn helps in establishing a comfortable and engaging relationship between the manager and team members.\n\n\n3. Be objective, not reflexive with your emotions\n\n\nHaving control over your emotions and them not influencing your interactions with your team members is a vital part of effective communication. Temper is not good for communication. However, we are all human and as a general trait, we do tend to get angry, but the important measure would be to assess these situations and proactively act towards them. Understanding how your employees perceive you when you yell and how accommodating they are to the same is a vital metric that needs to be observed along with how such heated conversations are affecting your working environment. Moreover, it is advised not to have heated conversations as emotions override any content we’re trying to share.\n\n\n4. Praise more, criticize less\n\n\nEveryone likes appreciation and recognition for the effort they put in. The best leaders identify these efforts and praise them to ensure the continuity of productivity. Moreover the best managers create an environment in which their team members want to excel. Mutual respect is best fostered through praise, support and steady encouragement. Creating a positive work environment naturally leads towards creation of a more engaged workforce. When a leader recognizes the efforts of the team, they feel empowered, supported, and are motivated to push themselves to the edge of their abilities to do the best job possible.\n\n\nAt the Taplow Group S.A, We are a team that is focused towards identifying and delivering the best talents as required by our clients.

Hosted by CBRE and Investment Briefings, a panel of senior directors from CBRE, AF Advisory, Principle Real Estate, Fidelity and IMMO Investment Technologies gave their views on the Real Estate sector outlook and took questions from attendees.\n\n\nWhilst it was agreed that 2018 had shown resilience and growth, Asia had seen a marked dip in investments monies whilst Europe had held firm and the USA had once again seen significant growth in 2018. It was also agreed that the markets globally were at a peak, however this peak has been steady for some time and a downturn or market correction is due if one looked at historical data for the warning signs that are now present. The feeling amongst the panel was that 2019 would see slightly above average growth in the UK, Europe and USA, with pockets of uncertainty driving some markets/sectors down. Most of those who were present, expected 2020 to be the crunch year that would see a market correction.\n\n\nKey global influencers, such as Asia and USA along with political issues will have effects on the markets, political influencer are to have an impact not seen before, the rise of populism in Europe and elections coming up in key European countries t could lead to nationalistic governments, Brexit uncertainty, continuing trade sanctions across the globe and USA Presidential pronouncements have and will continue to have an adverse effect on investor confidence, however the expected market correction is forecasted to be swift and short.\n\n\nKey areas for optimism are that office occupancy is holding firm although yields are slightly down as new builds come on stream and companies seek to become more flexible on contracts and deposits.The residential market is growing across Europe and the demand for more residences is strong. The retail sector is anticipated to go through a period of change as “bricks for clicks” continues to gain traction across Europe. Logistics, university residence and senior citizen housing are forecasted to continue to attract investment. There is no doubt that investment opportunities will become scarcer as required yields are harder to seek out but there remains a desire from investors to continue to invest in Real Estate.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (2847)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "4 Reasons To Choose An Executive Search Firm\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nSuperUser Account\n/\nFriday, November 23, 2018\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the business and hiring practices continue to evolve, the availability of talent seems to have become more and more scarce. In such a scenario, search firms with specialized teams of headhunters are considered safer to find and, more importantly, qualify candidates for specialized roles than in house recruiters. Most of the time the in house recruiters just look for individuals with the same job title, and over look the importance of the type of experience, varied exposure to both specific and broad-based areas of expertise, and the importance of finding an individual who has worked with a similar company. Just like in the medical profession, there are general practitioners, and then there are specialists – in the executive search business, the headhunter is the specialist.\n\n\nHere are four good reasons to use Executive Search Services to meet your needs.\n\n\n1. Industry Know-how\n\n\nHeadhunters at most of the executive search firms have often held key positions in the industry for which they recruit. Finding the best fit becomes much easier due to the specific sector expertise as well as a wide and well-established network.\n\n\n2. Relevant Experience With Challenging Assignments\n\n\nThere are times when the position to be filled calls for a very specific expertise. For example, an organization is looking for technical expertise and experience in B2B sales for data solutions. Finding the right person is almost impossible if you don’t have a technical sales network in data solutions or related verticals. An executive search team comes with the support of a team that pools its networks in various technical fields. The entire team will collaborate and rake their networks to get you the best fit, which in turn will save you valuable time.\n\n\n3. Reputation Amongst the ‘Talent Pool’\n\n\nTo attract a highly coveted talent pool, an organization may want to work with a firm that comes with a good reputation and displays a high level of professionalism. At The Taplow Group, you have access to the best talent pool as we come with one of the most reputed names in this business. And this is one of the major reasons that we get a lot of referrals, which are a key part of our strategy. Simply put, good resources bring in other good resources on board. We make our network work for you!\n\n\n4.\n \nGlobal Reach, Local Presence\n\n\nWith offices in nearly every corner of the world, and employees on the ground in key regions, they offer multiple benefits for organizations: A true global reach, and knowledgeable, local staff that can help you navigate local nuances.\n\n\nHave you run into any specific challenges while looking for resources with special talents and skills? We offer executive search, recruitment services, management consulting and professional search to the leading clients.

However, one doesn’t become an outstanding leader by sheer stroke of luck or accident. It requires great planning. Great leaders organize and plan ahead. Thinking through various scenarios and possible impacts requires analytical thinking skills. Managing people requires a humanitarian side to your personality. It would not be an exaggeration to say that leaders need to lead with both, their head and their heart.\n\n\nEffective leaders have many common qualities. However, one needs to constantly make the effort to practice and learn the skills it takes to be an effective leader. Here’s some sound advice on how you can become a more effective leader for your people.\n\n\nBe both flexible and firm:\n In order to be an effective leader, you have to learn to balance being unbending and being adaptable. Great leaders know how to go with the flow without losing direction, moving their organization forward with resilience and alertness.\n\n\nDelegate efficiently:\n Many leaders feel the need to be in control of every little thing. As an effective leader, you must allow others to do their job and encourage them do it well. When you delegate intelligently, you instil leadership skills, confidence and trust within your team.\n\n\nSet direction: \nEvery employee needs some sort of direction. Set specific and measurable goals with your team. Ensure that you regularly monitor their progress not only against their own goals but also their contribution toward organizational goals.\n\n\nCommunicate with honesty and clarity: \nLeaders who don’t communicate clearly enough or often enough often tend to mislead their teams. Make the effort to keep your team informed, and communicate clearly so that the team can work without any communication gaps.\n\n\nBe accessible and available: \nAt the end of it, leadership is all about your people. When someone needs you, it’s time to look up, make eye contact, set aside your work and your phone and any other distractions, and focus on the person standing in front of you.\n\n\nDon’t be just a problem solver: \nThere will always be problems, and there will always be a need for leaders who can create timely solutions that endure. Don’t be a leader who would settle for quick fixes that may cause bigger problems down the road. Focus on fixing the cause of the problem instead of treating the symptoms.\n\n\nConsistently recognize the achievements of others.\n  Every team member wants to do a good job. And when they do, they want recognition from their leader. The simple act of recognizing and rewarding employees for a job well done is enough to set you apart as a leader.\n\n\nLead From Within: \nIf you want to grow into a truly effective leader, start today and cultivate these skills. So that, when the time comes, you’ll be prepared to steer your organization and people in the right direction.\n\n\nTo sum it all up, a good leader has to have a purpose that is larger than what he/she is. They should be capable enough to balance their personality and skills to put that purpose into action. At The Taplow Group we know that the practice of leadership development is a continuous process. The organizations also need to more closely examine what they expect of leaders and how to develop them.  Our Certified CEO program is an online certification course for today and tomorrow's CEOs and senior managers to hone their skills as more effective leaders.

Hiring the right talent for mission-critical roles influences and drives organizational success. Hiring mistakes are expensive in terms of both direct and indirect costs. This is the reason why winning the battle for the most talented professionals becomes even more important. Executive Search Firms help organizations make the \"right hiring choices\" and add significant value to their workforce. Partnering with an Executive Search Firm often plays a key role in identifying, attracting, and acquiring ‘Key Talent’ for an organization.\n\n\nSo, selecting an Executive Search Firm is as critical as the final hire itself. Here are a few things to keep in mind when trying to identify the right Firm for your organization:\n\n\n\n\nKnowledge about Industry\n\n\n\n\nYou must look for someone who comes with the requisite experience in the sphere your organization operates. This doesn’t end here. The Executive Search Firm should also be able to recognize the unique role of your company in the industry and its culture. They should understand your priorities, goals, vision and challenges.\n\n\n\n\nPast Experience\n\n\n\n\nThe Executive Search Firm’s past record is very important. Their work in your industry especially, should be reviewed. Be sure to see where their candidates are now and how well they did after they were employed. Check out the references they share with you to make a sound decision.\n\n\n\n\nMethodology\n\n\n\n\nExecutive Search Firms use a wide variety of tools to get the job done. Sometimes experience and knowing the right people works. At other times, an industry may demand the use of innovative techniques to seek out the right employee. What fits your industry and what position you’re looking to fill can help dictate which Executive Search Firm to go for. A good Executive Search Firm will know how to assess whether a candidate will fit into your organisation or not.\n\n\n\n\nSpeed\n\n\n\n\nNo Executive Search Firm can credibly commit to finding an applicant in a short time span. However, this is not to say that you should not factor in the amount of time they will take. Take a look at their results to get an idea of what to expect. A good Executive Search Firm will be able to balance time pressures with thoughtful processes to close a position well in time.\n\n\nMost of all use your own judgment. An Executive Search Firm would be interested in listening to your concerns and willing to understand what you need. Much like in the case of a new employee, you don’t want to hire someone who doesn’t understand what you need.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, we consider every search as a \nPartnership\n—not only by making a fruitful hire, but also by building a successful and thriving team. Our partner organizations generally find that the input and perspectives we provide are helpful well beyond the scope of the specific search. Reach out to us at \nwww.TaplowGroup.com\n for more information on how we can best partner with you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (5806)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Success and growth, more often than not, comes coupled with heavy workloads and long hours. As a result our personal lives can inevitably take a hit. Being plugged in to work at all times via email and text takes a heavy toll on both, the health and the happiness.\n\n\nHow do you feel when you’re done for the day at work?  Do you feel excited about doing things that you love besides work, like spending time with your family, pursuing a hobby or are you merely looking at replenishing your energy to start another workday? If you are thinking about your deadlines, meetings and other office tasks while you are not at your desk, it’s time to introspect. You need to work out a plan so that your work responsibilities aren’t overwhelming your home life.\n\n\nFor a leader, maintaining peak performance at work, both for self and team members, often leads to stress and anxiety. Responsibilities and deadlines can easily roll over into a team member's personal life. And, as a repercussion, there could be anything from health problems, to burnout, to job dissatisfaction. It is therefore, in a leader’s interest to help himself and his team to ensure a healthy work environment where everyone can happily contribute to achieve organizational goals. As a matter of fact, stronger loyalties and better retention is observed in organizations that assist their employees in achieving a sound work-life balance.\n\n\nHere are few things that you as a leader can incorporate to have a steady work-life balance:\n\n\nSet priorities and work with unadulterated focus\n\n\nWorking hard when accompanied by working smart yields flawless results. While the leaders can motivate their team to work hard, they should also focus on working smart. The leaders must prioritise the work and subsequently delegate the work amongst their team members wisely. Proper planning and adequate work distribution helps in completing the task effectively and on time. Bottom line: While you are working, give your unadulterated focus to work, so that you not only complete the work on time but complete it flawlessly.\n\n\nWork flexibility\n\n\nDon’t be a horse with blinkers that cannot see anything barring the goal. Flexibility in working style and hours not only helps you to be more creative and satisfied but also immensely assists in balancing your work and personal life. If you’re giving your best to the job, time and style don’t matter. Leaders should allow their team members to adjust their work time in harmony with their personal life. Once the task is assigned, a leader or his team members must have the freedom to work out their schedules as per their convenience to meet their objectives.\n\n\nIncorporate technology\n\n\nTechnology not only helps you to be more effective at work, but also plays its part in maintaining a work-life balance. Access to technology has made a lot of things automated and digital, thereby making your work easier and faster. Leaders must employ the latest applications and software that can help them accomplish their tasks more efficiently. They can also extend the same practice to their team and help them to achieve a work-life balance for themselves.\n\n\nRespect your personal commitments\n\n\nLeaders who are usually burdened with responsibilities often ignore their personal commitments. Gradually they develop this into a habit and feel guilt-free on compromising with personal obligations. They should set new principles for themselves that gives their private life equal importance and inspire their team members to follow suit.\n\n\nIt is essential for a leader to have a happy and satisfied team in order to have a congenial atmosphere at work. So, while maintaining a balance between their own work and personal life, they should also set an example for their team members to follow.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group we focus on Training and Development programs for Leaders to enable them to nurture successful and happy teams. We encourage our partner organizations to consider ways to open up the lines of communication and have an on going dialogue with all employees.

Focus towards incorporating innovative techniques is increasing, and measures to map competent talent are being extensively researched. Furthermore, factors like growing competition and increased demand have prompted companies to extensively invest in and redefine their hiring practices, thus making human capital management the major influencer of any organisations’ growth strategy.\n\n\nIntroduction of candidates from diverse backgrounds has been one successful practice that has resulted in a culturally inclusive and productive environment at many places.Inclusion of people from different ethnicities has enabled organisations to gain insights globally and also to break barriers between nationalities and races,thus resulting in higher productivity. As organisations are looking to become global players, it has become important for them to include talent that can be productive in their various geographical areas. Diversity not only encourages organisations to keep the biases aside but also leads to a deeper level of innovation and creativity, increased ability to localize to new markets, and the ability to be adaptable.\n\n\nHere area few key parameters to keep in mind to help increase diversity within your organisation:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEstablish diversity as the critical value for the organisation: \nThink about the future of the organisation!In a competitive space, acquiring talent which is diverse, can give you greater sustainability and an edge over competition as you could be serving more geographies or offering services in more languages etc.\n\n\nSwitch to performance based hiring approach: \nThis approach gives an equal chance to everyone without any biases creeping it. You can do a skill assessment as a first step to weed out least suitable prospects. This gives you a fair chance of effectively evaluating candidates with different but equal experiences.\n\n\nEmploy a diverse set of interviewers: \nYour interview panel can make a difference! A gender mix in your interview panel showcases homogeneity within your organisation thus promoting the prospects to share the ideals and virtues. Interviewers belonging to different genders and races sends out a clear message that biases are not encouraged and only competency is gauged.\n\n\n\n\nConsidering the various tenets that organisations explore, in order to increase productivity, diversity within the workforce is a positive step towards growth and success. The prediction for the future says thatby 2022 the workforce is expected to comprise of 47% women and 40% minorities. If we find a way to accommodate candidates from diverse backgrounds and become a magnet for openness,diversity and inclusion, we will have stronger companies and stronger futures.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, we assist our partner organisations to advance their diversity goals through our hiring practices.We search for world-class leadership talent and help build outstanding teams that spell both, success and growth.\n\n\nFor more information, please visit us at \nwww.TaplowGroup.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (5585)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "7 Reasons Why Mentors Are A Must\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nSuperUser Account\n/\nWednesday, September 26, 2018\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGiven the unique and highly stressful nature of modern workplaces, everyone in their life must have at least one great mentor who inspires and encourages them continuously. As a mentor has already experienced and survived the rigmaroles of the corporate world, he or she has the perfect wisdom to impart. Apart from helping their mentees take career-defining decisions, mentors are also a necessity when it comes to feeling confident and gaining important resources to get ahead, both in personal and professional lives.\n\n\nHere are the top ten reasons why you must have a mentor in life:\n\n\n1.They help you set goals\n\n\nAs a newbie, very often we tend to overlook the line that separates wishful thinking from achievable goals. A mentor helps you set measurable goals for yourself. Without goals, you are most likely to go dormant or maybe even move backwards in life. Therefore, having a set of clear goals helps you to keep moving forward and stay motivated. Besides that, a mentor not just tells you what to do but also helps you to find ways of doing it.\n\n\n2.They provide information and knowledge\n\n\nThere are many times when we are looking for some information but don’t know whom to ask? With a mentor by our side, we know exactly whom to turn to for answers. A mentor provides you with information and a wealth of knowledge that helps you move faster in life by shortening the learning curve. \n\n\n3.They understand your weaknesses and strengths\n\n\nA mentor showers harsh criticism and encouraging appreciation with equal élan, both of which are necessary for growth. They understand what your weaknesses are and help you overcome them by using your strengths. This allows you to \nunderstand\n how you can be most effective at what you do in a given situation or circumstance.\n\n\n4.They never let you stop or become satisfied\n\n\nContinuous goal setting helps you to keep moving ahead in life. Not allowing you to rest on your laurels, a mentor gives you the confidence, which encourages you to make an attempt at trying something new. They offer you inspiration, provide you with a better perspective and most of all, they are always there to watch your back.\n\n\n5.They always keep a check on you\n\n\nThey don’t let you cheat on your goals or divert from your priorities. Whether you are looking for a new job, growth in your current role, starting or growing your own business, having a great mentor by your side will help you progress and achieve your full potential faster.\n\n\n6.Being experienced, they prevent you from making mistakes\n\n\nA mentor saves you from the distressing effects of not knowing. Since, they are already ahead of you on the learning curve, they know very well what works and what does not. Hence, they save your time and effort from being wasted on the stuff that doesn’t really yield any result.\n\n\n7. They stimulate your growth\n\n\nWhile they save you from making major mistakes that can have devastating effects on your life and career, they also give you opportunities to learn things on your own. Mentors guide you on how to go about with things, but once that done, they sit and watch from a distance while you go about finding your own way of doing things that contribute towards your growth and success.\n\n\nMentors extend their personal support to facilitate your success. People who experience good mentoring also have a greater chance at career advancement. Therefore, their role in your professional evolution is priceless. Having a great mentor in life that can steer you towards success is nothing short of a blessing. They are important at every stage of your career. If you don’t have one yet, it’s time you find one.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, our reputation over the years in the making has been built on successful searches for board members, chief and senior executives, and functional experts.

Maxwell\n\n\nA ‘Good Leader’ sets up his team for success while a ‘Great Leader’ shows and teaches his team how to succeed. So, the question is what makes a ‘Great Leader’? There is no ‘Right Mix’ for becoming a “Great Leader”. There may be many common traits, strengths, and skills that majority of great leaders possess. However, what significantly improves career performance and helps to stand out among other executive candidates is the ability to acquire, develop and utilize these qualities. While leadership styles may vary from leader-to-leader, great leaders share a number of common traits that augment their success. \n\n\nLeadership traits\n refer to personal \nqualities\n that are the hallmark of effective \nleaders\n. \nSo, what should you look for is what we have tried to decipher here.For a correct assessment of traits for an executive leader,the headhunter should look at:\n\n\nPhysical Traits:\n\n\nMany a times, people tend to dismiss the importance of physical fitness for healthy functioning of the mind and body. People who pay attention to their physical well-being are found to be more energetic and are better equipped to manage the demands made on C-suite executives, both physically and mentally. Based on research, it has been identified that distinguished C Suite leaders have a high capacity for productive work output along with high work endurance and stamina. This necessarily does not imply that you conduct health assessments to measure the physical competency but rather inquire about their involvement in physical, co-curricular activities along with their hobbies to get an idea about their physical endurance.\n\n\nPersonal Traits:\n\n\nPersonality and character that the C-level executive embodies defines his or her leadership style. Personal traits, like emotional stability, enthusiasm,\n conscientiousness,self-assurance, Intuitiveness etc.,\n play a major role in determining who will and who will not be comfortable leading others. For example, leaders who have charisma are able to ilicit strong emotions in their employees by defining a vision which unites and captivates them. There are various Psychometric Tests for Leadership that are specially crafted to identify competencies that one is expected to posses. These tests enable a headhunter to select the best candidate for the role and organization. \n\n\nPerformance Traits: \n\r\nPast Performance provides valuable insights towards the candidate’s competencies but must be gauged carefully\n. \n\n\n\n\nA proven track record along with compelling performance reviews indicating positive growth are some important records to look at.\n\n\nAlong with this, try to identify the obstacles the candidate may have faced in the past and ask for innovative solutions for the same. Ask significant questions related to performance versus the goals and expectations of current or previous organisation to guage leadeship effectiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore , make a concious effort to understand the core values that the candidate displays and how aligned are they with your organisations values.\n\n\n\n\nA leader defines the direction of the business and the responsibility for identifying the right direction for the organisation needs to lie with someone who is dynamic as well diligent. Considering the fact that there is so much at stake, it has become quintessential for companies to identify the correct leader for their organisation.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group,we take our commitment to our clients very seriously, and take pride in delivering an exceptional level of service and expertise to them. Right from pertinent management experience to tangible awards, achievements and failures, we closely analyze the individual to determine if he or she is the perfect fit for the role that we are hiring for.

It is about celebrating the differences! In order to be profitable in a globalized marketplace, smart businesses are continuously making efforts to embrace it in every possible way, be it religious and political beliefs, gender, ethnicity, education, socioeconomic background, sexual orientation, geographic location or any other distinct differences between people. Organisations are leaving no stone unturned to create an inclusive environment, which accepts each individual's differences, embraces their strengths and provides opportunities for everyone to achieve their full potential.\n\n\nStudies have indicated that a diverse workforce can bring in sale revenues fifteen times more than a workforce with lesser diversity. In order to succeed, your team should be as diverse as the audience you expect to have. Hence, if you dream of expanding your business locally or globally, you must have employees who understand and can cater to such varied global clients.\n\n\nHere are just a few of the top benefits of workplace diversity in the modern business landscape:\n\n\nInspires Innovation\n\n\nPeople coming from different races and communities have different ideas and thought processes. Therefore, bringing together such diverse people under one roof would inspire innovation and creativity; it is true for all kinds of businesses, from start-ups to big industry players. Such different people can connect to a wider audience and cater to their demands with more intelligent solutions.\n\n\nOpens up Global Opportunities\n\n\nHaving a diverse workforce can help an organisation position itself better in the foreign market. The chances of competing globally for any organisation increases multiple times if they have a team which is diverse, in terms of race, community and language. It equips the organisation with broader range of skills and proficiency that ultimately results in long-term business and profitability.\n\n\nEnhances Engagement with Employees\n\n\nA diverse workforce also encourages team cohesion and engagement. People from different backgrounds have a lot to share and learn from each other, which urges them to work together in more interesting ways. However, such diversity must also be respected and valued by the employers as it gives a sense of honour and satisfaction to the employees.Business success is heavily dependent on creating a strong relationship with customers. A team, which has a rich engagement, is more productive and enables stronger customer relationships, which translates into more profit for the business.\n\n\nThere are no two ways about the fact that organisations which comprise of a diverse workforce, have a clear competitive advantage. However, the big question is how to effectively, fairly, and objectively increase diversity at workplace?\n\n\nTalent acquisition is one tool that can be used effectively to increase diversity in the workplace. At The Taplow Group, we believe that diversity at workplace begins with transformational leadership, because it is the leaders who adapt and connect with the entire workforce in order to maximize the benefits of diversity. We help our partner organisations to put a diverse leadership team in place in order to be successful at workplace diversity. Our global presence enables us to generate numerous synergies to offer a full international outreach to our partners.\n\n\nTo know more about The Taplow Group, visit us at \nwww.TaplowGroup.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (7283)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

In the foreseeable future, it is imperative that the demand for top executives will rise as organisations are rapidly growing and expanding. Considering such a daunting task at stake, qualified executive talent has become harder to find.\n\n\nDaunting tasks can be tackled by breaking down problems into small fractions and addressing them diligently. Here are five key executive search tips for navigating through these recruitment challenges.\n\n\nIdentifying the Right Executive Search Firm\n\n\nExecutive Search firm acts as a bridge between the talent pool and the organisation. The major advantage of a search firm is their ability to uncover new candidates—including potential passive candidates that are not actively looking for a new opportunity.\n\n\nThe right questions lead to competent evaluations and essentially help you understand the candidate holistically. Considering that you’re leaving the onus on the Executive Search firm, certain questions mentioned below can help you identify the correct search firm for your needs.\n\n\n\n\nCan the executive search firm tap into talent pools that are inaccessible to you?\n\n\nDo their consultants specialize in your organization’s industry and sector?\n\n\nWho are the consultants who will execute your search?\n\n\nCan they wield the proper resources and geographical reach?\n\n\nWhat methodology does the firm employ to ensure a long-term, successful hire?\n\n\nHow much will the search firm keep your organization involved in the process?\n\n\n\n\nBring in all the stakeholders\n\n\nThe executive search process cannot be handled singularly by one person, it requires insights and briefs from all the stakeholders including the board of directors/senior management, external stakeholders at times and especially the hiring manager.. It is quite essential that stakeholders are briefed and are continuously updated as they can contribute to the process in a timely and meaningful manner.\n\n\nClear and Definite Job roles and Job Description\n\n\nThe job description is a highly crucial part of the recruitment process. Having clear cut goals and responsibilities discussed and defined with the inputs from all the stakeholders is very important. These documents bring in clarity into the recruitment process, both from the candidate side as well as from the recruiter side. Furthermore, meet with the executive search firm, discuss your expectations and then come to a mutual agreement.\n\n\nSet Clear Goals \n\n\nConsidering how tedious the executive search process is, it does have its complexities. A simpler way to tackle these complexities is to define and set realistically achievable goals. Clearly define the roles and responsibilities for those who will be actively involved in the executive search process to keep the communications transparent and fluidic.\n\n\nKeep Clarity in Communication\n\r\nEstablish a communication protocol. This essentially ensures streamlining of the process along with the transparency of the stages that are followed. Clarity in communication between the organisation and the executive search firm leads to more engagement. On the other hand, if the communication breaks down, the search process can come to a halt, and a highly qualified candidate might be missed as a result. Even with the most effective strategies, the search process requires large investments of time and resources. Hence, it is quite important that the candidate selection process must be straightforward and transparent backed with resources from the search firm to facilitate the recruitment process comprehensively.\n\n\nThe Taplow Group has worked with several clients globally, to headhunt for a wide range of positions in various industries. We understand how important it is to find the “right fit” to fill your position and are well versed with handling a search process with the utmost clarity and precision.

    "content": "Hiring at C-level? Here's What to Look For\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nSuperUser Account\n/\nFriday, September 7, 2018\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \nNo rating\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to hiring, every position matters in a company but C-level recruitments are one of the most crucial and the most challenging positions to fill. Also, known as the C-suite, C-level executives are the ones who sit at the top of the funnel as the chief members of the organization. Their role in the organization requires them to deal with highly sensitive information, making decisions that shape the company culture and the future of the entire business. Therefore, to make the C-level recruitment a success, you must tread vigilantly and find the right person for the job.\n\n\nWhile qualifications, experience and records of previous positions held, pose as significant parameters for evaluation, there are several other aspects that need to be considered and evaluated before on-boarding any candidate. If you want to make your C-level recruitment successful, look at the below delineated must-have qualities in your candidate. Always remember, a bad hire at the C-level can have a domino effect on the rest of your business.\n\n\nPassion \n\n\n“With great power, comes great responsibility”. Along with this, the passion to do the right things with the power is the ultimate virtue. People sitting at such important positions must exhibit a passion for their work. It takes dedication and an inflexible zeal to motivate you to work hard towards achieving success. A CEO or a COO (C-level executives) needs to break the boundaries and go that extra mile to get things done, essentially differentiating them from other employees who are still very settled in their 9-5 jobs.\n\n\nCommunication and Social Skills\n>\n\n\nClear and effective communication is one of the most important traits of C-level executives. Along with flawless interpersonal skills, they should have excellent communication skills in order to effectively communicate with the team and to avoid confusions and misunderstanding with respect to tasks assigned. Thus, increasing the productivity of the team. As C-level executives are considered representatives of the organization, effective social skills among the C-level executives add value to the organization represented.\n\n\nImpeccable Decision-Making\n\n\nThe ability to take smart and swift decisions is an important trait you must look for while hiring personnel for the C-suite. At such high positions, making important decisions accounts as crucial responsibilities of C-level executives. It is imperative that C-level executives should be decisive and possess the ability to act out smartly and quickly.  \n\n\nLead by Example\n\n\nEvery employee looks up to their boss. Being an inspiration among your employees results in a positive and highly motivated workforce. Remember the saying, “If you are motivated on the inside, you surely \nwill be an inspiration on the outside too”. Look for someone who displays an ability to inspire the team to do better. This quality also proves favorable outside the office thus adding value to the person and the organization represented.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, we understand that a wrong hire can prove to be very expensive. Therefore, we take time to research the role and its requirements and then look for the perfect fit with relevant experience and passion; someone who has the ability to take a company from where it is now to where it wants to be. At every step of the hiring process, we share a belief and passion for your vision.

With the best talent being courted by every other company, candidates find themselves rich in choices and opportunities. Having competent individuals for such coveted positions is a proven way of success for companies, while on the other hand closing a single C-level search takes a lot of time and effort. Therefore, it is crucial that mistakes are not made while recruiting a member of the C-suite.\n\n\nStated below are four common mistakes that employers generally make while hiring C-level executives:\n\n\nSticking to the rudimentary ways instead of moving beyond the traditional means\n\n\nHiring a C-level executive is not just about checking all the boxes. Simply conducting a test and a subsequent interview is not the adequate way to hire a C-level executive. It needs a more interpersonal approach that helps in identifying the right person for the position. Engaging with the candidate on both personal and professional level is important and selling the company values and core work to them is equally significant. It helps both, recruiter and the candidate in making a sound decision. Digital tools and technologies have exposed us to a number of new ways to evaluate potential and skills that are hard to spot on paper, such as problem-solving, interpersonal skill, and job readiness. For example, video interviews allow a headhunter to evaluate characteristics like, body language, sense of humour and manner of speaking, which cannot be detected via a cover letter. Also, digital technologies enable hiring of passive candidates is through social media. For example, one can look for executives who demonstrate expertise or thought leadership in their field and pitch a job to them, which they might even not have heard or known about.\n\n\nKeep hunting for that perfect candidate\n\n\nWhen the recruitment process starts, the recruiters realise there is an abundance of candidates looking for aspiring opportunities. Every recruiter is looking to hire the perfect candidate who can steer the company towards success. Since C-level positions are extremely vital, sometimes the more experienced candidates may not share the same enthusiasm and motivation towards the position due to their prior involvement in similar roles. While, on the other hand, younger talent can prove to be not just a profiting bet but also that they showcase the zeal to prove themselves when presented with an opportunity. It would be imprudent for an organisation to spend months looking for the perfect candidate when there are exceptionally qualified, smart and capable people available. Companies need leaders who can think creatively and solve problems on the go. A smart person can always figure out how to do the right thing, even if he is from a different function or industry or is much younger for the role by the norms.\n\n\nNot giving importance to HR tech\n\n\nWhile the growth of technology has revamped every other field, the human resources function still awaits its turn. There are countless technologies in the market that are designed to help HR managers in making better organizational and hiring decisions. These tools are highly efficient and can be streamlined with accordance to the different working styles of organizations, along with customizations, to facilitate hiring needs.\n\n\nNot dismissing the person when it must be done\n\n\nA wrong person in the organization is akin to a sick fish in a pond; both tend to create detrimental effect overall. A ‘bad hire’ is worse than ‘no hire’. If at any stage you realise that you might have hired the wrong person, could be a cultural misfit or an underperformer, do not hesitate to take action, even if it a hard step of asking the person to leave. Because a lot of time and expenses are consumed in hiring, organisations often try and take remedial action. Remedial action could range from mentoring or coaching with an opportunity to get better.\n\n\nIn other cases, they often wait until they find a replacement. Both these maneuvers have proved faulty, and fetch no rewards. Remove the elements that obstruct growth and inflate negativity in the organization.  \n\n\nIn order to avoid these mistakes, many organizations partner with an experienced executive search firm like The Taplow Group to find the candidates they want. Our executive experts match top talent to companies seeking effective, experienced and dynamic leaders.

During the recent past, the hiring process has become a two-way street, where both the employer and candidate are in a position to accept or reject. This has swelled the importance of candidate experience. And when you are on a lookout for a C-level executive, the significance grows even higher. Today, talented candidates find themselves with a plethora of options, which subsequently has resulted in candidates being picky about their opportunities and started considering things other than the payroll while deciding which offer to accept.\n\n\nIt is evident that companies today take good care and pay attention to proving a good experience to candidates. However, the question remains, what further innovative measures can be employed to improve the hiring process along with identifying and hiring the best talents in the market. \n\r\nBelow outlined are four must-do practices:\n\n\nRestructure your job description to make it crisp and appropriate\n\n\nThe first step of the recruitment process is putting out the job description, and it is also the starting point of the candidate experience.  Many candidates complain that the job descriptions provided by the companies were either too vague (not giving much information) or are too lengthy, both of which are equally frustrating. Therefore, focus on putting crisp and appropriate information in the job description, which might include the job profile, core responsibilities, location and little about the company and its values. The rest can be addressed during conversations.\n\n\nStreamline your application process\n\n\nYour application process must be clear and non-fussy. Get rid of everything that even remotely makes the process lengthy and frustrating. For instance, the long forms asking the details that are already mentioned in the resumes is a common thing that not only makes the application process wearisome but also exudes a negative candidate experience.\n\n\nCommunicate with the applicants\n\n\nFrequent and quick communication with applicants immensely helps in establishing positive candidate experience. With the presently available tools and technology, it has become easier to keep the communication going. The hiring managers must set an automated email for people applying or sending cover letters while the prospects above that stage must be sent direct mails without delays.  Also, at whichever stage an applicant is signed off, a response is a must!\n\n\nBreaking the Ice is very important!\n\n\nThe hiring process for everyone, even candidates for C-suite roles, can prove to be a very anxious period. Therefore, the employers must employ practices that can provide a comfortable environment for the candidates. This may include ice breaking activities like a tour of the office or an introduction to the team members. Such activities not just make the candidates feel comfortable but are also an excellent opportunity for exhibiting the company’s work culture.\n\n\nToday’s hiring landscape does not allow you to bargain with candidate experience; it is something that you must actively work on to get the best talent on board. Streamline your hiring processes with the above mentioned parameters and facilitate competent hiring practices for your organization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (7032)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "7 Habits that will help you become a Successful Recruiter\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nSuperUser Account\n/\nThursday, August 23, 2018\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \n 5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is the responsibility of a hiring manager to get the best talent on-board for the company, however, to recruit the best talent, the recruiter himself must also be the best. In other words, it takes a smart and skilful recruiter to hire equally intelligent and skilled people. Therefore, along with the must-haves, i.e. the skill, experience and intuition, incorporating these seven habits will help you become a successful recruiter.\n\n\nKeep your focus on getting the right candidate\n\n\nWhile the demand for top executives is expected to grow in the immediate future, the qualified executive talent is becoming increasingly harder to find. Understand the key experience and competencies needed for the job and assess the candidates strengths against those requirements. Always remember, your job is to get the right candidate rather than “a candidate”, to work closely with the client on ensuring a successful hire, and ensuring that the candidate is able to add value to the company.\n\n\nReinvent your approach to work\n\n\nGoing by the traditional hiring means is passé. Presently, with the rife availability of tools and technologies, the recruiters must modernize their approach. They must deploy technologies in ways that increase their efficiency. They must streamline their way of screening the candidates using the appropriate tools in order to identify the best candidate more efficiently and quickly.\n\n\nWork on your outreach\n\n\nThe initial outreach decides whether the candidate’s response will be affirmative or not. The outreach of the hiring manager must have the power to get the prospects excited about the position. Sharing the right details, asking open ended questions and explaining the job description with an insightful approach are few ways to perfect the outreach. A good recruiter always leaves his personal touch in all his emails and responses are aimed at making the candidate feel important.\n\n\nKeep track of your efforts\n\n\nMaintaining data of all the work done helps in keeping track of all the outcomes which further aids in identifying the successful parameters of the recruitment process.  Recruiters must keep a record of each candidate’s application journey, including from source applied from, which level of hiring they reached, and how the candidate experience was.  A knowledge of these will help in understanding better what must be included during the next hiring process and what must be avoided.\n\n\nMaintain your work calendar\n\n\nSince the recruitment process is a multitude of tasks, it is crucial for the recruiters to stay organized as ill management often results in losing a good prospect. Maintaining a strict work calendar that explicitly defines each task for the day promotes efficient working. Also, while planning your calendar, align tasks in the most productive way, for instance, the jobs that bore you the most must be kept first to be done while you are still enthusiastic about the project.\n\n\nMake the maximum use of resources at your disposal.\n\n\nFrom screening to scheduling and communicating to reviewing, recruiters have a lot on their plate.  Therefore, certain automation and AI tools can be used to reduce work pressure and in turn also to increase the efficiency of the output. Use these tools to your benefit by employing them at strategic places, thus making the recruitment process a lot easier.\n\n\nPut your efforts in maintaining the company’s reputation\n\n\nThe company’s reputation is directly related to the hiring process. If the company has a bad reputation, it is quite likely that lesser candidates will be interested in applying for a job there. Hence, a recruiter must take control of maintaining the company’s reputation. They must regularly monitor the companies brand reputation by constantly reviewing websites like Glassdoor and Indeed. They should be aware of the problems the company is facing and contribute towards resolving them. A recruiter must work towards building a strong reputation for the company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (6879)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

Its relevance in IT and anticipating sales is well known. What is less known is how it can be leveraged to improve other fields. Recruitment is one such field that stands to be upgraded by the introduction of AI, but again only some aspects of it.\n\n\nTake talent acquisition and retention for example, which is necessary for the continued success of any organization. AI can help you do some bit of the basic research basis some clear cut parameters, which we also call the \n“hygiene factors”\n; Industry relevant experience, years of experience, designation, age, educational qualifications and others. \n\n\nAnother aspect where an organization can use AI to find their next top performer, is by using data on those who are currently working for them. It does so by listing hygiene factors of the current employees, which then can help identify similar viable candidates for them.\n\n\nFor example, what the recruiters and hiring managers can start doing is gather profiles, performance reviews, or any information at all about the highly successful people that already work for them and plug that into an algorithm to figure out what their organization is looking for. This would lead to an increase in the efficiency of the hiring process.\n\n\nThere are varied views on whether AI can also improve candidate engagement, by possibly offering a better experience which could help to boost a company’s brand position. We at The Taplow Group feel that the human connect with candidates, the process of being their guide and analyst, and the human touch to the assessment and evaluation process can’t be taken over by machines, \njust not yet! :)\n\n\nFrom an organizations perspective, aside from this, AI can also help onboard new hires. AI systems can answer queries both complex and simple. So, whether employees need to know where the conference room is or how to sign up for health insurance, all they need to do is access a digital resource. This frees up managers to “connect with a new hire in more meaningful ways”.\n\n\nAt The Taplow Group, it is our constant endeavor to help improve talent acquisition efficiency and effectiveness for our partners. When organizations need new talent, they approach us to help them find the right people for the job. We focus on the right indicators while sourcing candidates, screening them across different interviews and eventually picking the right candidates to fill the position. We agree that AI can make recruiting smarter. However, there are certain things that only a human mind can comprehend, like emotions and creativity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (6974)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",

    "content": "10 Lessons Leaders Can Learn from the Football World Cup 2018\n\n\n\n\nAuthor: \nSuperUser Account\n/\nFriday, August 17, 2018\n/\nCategories: \nBlogs\n\n\n Rate this article: \nNo rating\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the luminaries in the stands to the stars on the field, from the despair and upsets to the delight and comebacks and from the own-goals to the stoppage time winners, the FIFA World Cup 2018 was a world cup to remember. It was a story of unapologetic and unrestrained football that gave us many moments of absolute brilliance. And while the people around the world got dazed into the fascinating and intriguing experience that this sport provides, we were busy chalking out some great lessons on leadership that were witnessed every now and then and those which can be a valuable medium of driving true inspiration.\n\n\nHere are the top 10:\n\n\nThe Charisma\n\n\nGareth Southgate, football manager of the team England, is an excellent example of a charismatic leader. He knew well how to employ his team members to bring out the best of their potentials, which is why even though the team did not consist of all super-talented players they did it quite well. A strong, charismatic leader is one who can persuade his team by establishing a strong personal and professional credibility.\n\n\nPressure is an indispensable part of any game\n\n\nOut of the 32 teams that marched to fields on the opening ceremony of FIFA 2018, only 16 went forward to the next round, and only one became the winner. Hence, since the beginning there existed immense pressure on each team that strived hard to emerge victorious. Thus, these teams teach us how to manage pressure and how to give your utmost best even under pity circumstances. A leader must stay focused and think positively even when the situation looks otherwise.\n\n\nStay flexible\n\n\nInjuries, suspensions and bad refereeing decisions many a time disrupt the plan with which the teams play. Therefore, they stay flexible in such derailing situations and keep working towards their ultimate goal. Similarly, the leaders must remain flexible to bewildering circumstances. In other words, a leader must adapt to the changes without letting them affect his work.\n\n\nLoosing is not the end\n\n\nJames Rodriguez in World Cup 2014 and Tim Howard in World Cup 2015 showed us how loosing a match is not a failure. With their tremendous performance, they were declared true winners in their respective matches even when they played for the lost side. This teaches us that you win no matter what, when \nyou give your best with sheer originality.\n\n\nTurn your weakness into your strength\n\n\nCurrent manager of the Brazil national team, Tite effectively turned the teams’ defensive weakness into their core strength. He helped the team create a new identity for themselves by fortifying their weakness. This is what leaders must do; they should reinvent the team by turning their weaknesses into their strengths. A leader must help each of his team members to overcome their limitations.\n\n\nIt needs a team to win\n\n\nFootball is a team sport, and there subsists no I in the team. A football team comprises an upright keeper, sturdy midfielders, exciting wingers, and others. Every single member plays an integral part in the team. In the same, a leader must work towards bringing up a group that works together in unison for the common feat. \n\n\nFootball is more than just an 11-man game\n\n\nTim Krull, a substitute player in the Dutch team brought victory for the team against Costa Rica when his coach summoned him at the end of the extra time just for the penalty kicks. The inspiration we derive from this incident is that a leader must know how to use his team effectively and should know when to plug in other sources.\n\n\nLead by example\n\n\nOscar Tabarez, the Uruguayan football manager, suffering from a rare Guillain-Barre Syndrome who uses an electric wheelchair or crutch showed us how you could lead well by example. The Uruguayan team had a reputation of being the masters of foul play. However, Tabarez infused in them a spirit of discipline, composure and tactical strength. Similarly, irrespective of the kind of team you have, a leader must possess the potential to transform them for good.\n\n\nMoney is not the ultimate driving force\n\n\nTwo of the most highly paid managers failed to bring their team beyond the group stage in World Cup 2016 while two of the lowest paid amongst the 32 teams took their teams to notable elevations. Another valuable lesson you learn from football is that money can never be the most important thing that motivates you. Many companies and people who have stacks of cash cannot achieve things that are being achieved by people with limited means but better talent.\n\n\nNever get disheartened and always stay positive\n\n\nThere can be no better example than football to show how one must celebrate every vicissitude of life. In 1998 finals, Japan lost to Croatia and yet the Japanese fans exhibited true sportsmanship by staying in a joyous mood. Leaders must infuse likewise feelings in their team. Sometimes it is not about winning or losing but it’s about the experience, which you must always rejoice.\n\n\n \n\n\nAspiring business leaders across the world require a myriad of skills and knowledge to lead and inspire their employees and grow their businesses. Also, ongoing leadership skills training ensures that leaders are on the right track to bring out the best in their employees.  At The Taplow Group S.A. we offer the Certified CEO program as an online certification course for today's and tomorrow's CEOs and senior managers… available globally, and without peer!\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of views (5940)\n/\nComments (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nlogin\n or \nregister\n to post comments.",
